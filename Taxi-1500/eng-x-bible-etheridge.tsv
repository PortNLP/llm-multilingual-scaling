49003013	Faith	WHEREFORE I pray that I may not weary in my affliction , which is on your account ,
45016018	Sin	For they who are thus serve not our Lord Jeshu Meshiha , but their bellies ; and with sweet words and benedictions seduce the hearts of the simple .
45001029	Sin	being filled with all wickedness , and uncleanness , and rancour , and malice , and rapacity , and envy , and murder , and contention , and deceit , and evil imaginings , and murmurings ,

43015022	Sin	If I had not come and spoken with them , they had not had sin ; but now have they no pretext for their sins .
51004005	Recommendation	In wisdom walk towards the outward ones , and redeem your opportunity .
45006006	Faith	For we know that our old man is crucified with him , that the body of sin might be abolished , that more we should not serve sin .
62003010	Sin	In this are distinguished the sons of Aloha from the sons of Satana ; every one who doeth not righteousness , nor loveth his brother , is not of Aloha .
45008007	Sin	Because the mind of the flesh is enmity towards Aloha ; for to the law of Aloha it is not subject , for it cannot be ;
44002026	Faith	Wherefore my heart is glad , And my glory rejoiceth : And also my body shall sojourn in hope ;
46010020	Sin	No : but that which the Heathens sacrifice , unto demons they sacrifice , and not unto Aloha . But I would not that you be participators with demons !
44013001	Description	But there were in the church of Antiokia prophets and teachers , Bar Naba and Shemun who was called Niger , and Lukios who was from the city of Kyrene , and Manael , a fosterbrother of Herodes Tetrarka , and Shaol .
49005006	Recommendation	lest any man deceive you with vain words ; for because of these cometh the anger of Aloha upon the sons of disobedience .
56001011	Sin	those , whose mouths it behoves to stop . Many houses they destroy , and teach what they ought not , for the sake of filthy gain .
43013011	Sin	For Jeshu knew who was betraying him ; therefore he said , Ye are not all of you clean .
43010001	Sin	AMEN , amen , I say to you , Whosoever entereth not by the door into the fold of the flock , but ascendeth by another place , he is a thief and a robber .
61002015	Sin	who , forsaking the straight way , have erred , and gone in the way of Belam bar Beur , who the wages of iniquity loved . But he had reproof of his transgression ;
44014005	Violence	But there was made a movement by the Gentiles and by the Jihudoyee and their chiefs to maltreat them , and to crush them with stones .
43021017	Description	Jeshu saith to him again the third time , Shemun bar Jona , lovest thou me ? And it grieved Kipha that he said to him the third time , Lovest thou me ? And he said to him , My Lord , all things thou understandest , thou knowest that I love thee . Jeshu saith to him , Feed my sheep .
66021027	Sin	and nothing shall enter into it that defileth , nor that worketh uncleanness ; but they who are written in the book of life of the Lamb .
66017004	Sin	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet , and golden with gold and precious stones and pearls ; having a cup of gold in her hand , full of pollutions and uncleanness of her fornications the earth .

45002022	Sin	and who sayest they should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? And thou who condemnest idols , dost thou despoil the sanctuary ?
45007008	Sin	And by this commandment sin found for itself an occasion , and completed in me all concupiscence . For without the law sin was dead .
44026017	Grace	And I will deliver thee from the people of the Jihudoyee , and from the other nations to whom I send thee ,
56003003	Sin	For we also were afore-time without understanding , and disobedient and erring , and were subjected to various lusts ; and in malice , and in envy we conversed , and were hateful , and also hating one another .
54005021	Recommendation	I attest thee before Aloha and our Lord Jeshu Meshiha and his elect angels , that thou keep these , ( precepts , ) and let not thy mind be pre-occupied by any thing , and do nothing with acceptance of persons .
58010035	Recommendation	Destroy not , therefore , the confidence which you have , for which there is a great reward .
46004002	Faith	So now is it required of a steward that he be one found faithful .
44009043	Description	And he was in Joppa days not a few , sojourning in the house of Shemun the tanner .
46003016	Grace	KNOW YOU not that you are the temple of Aloha , and ( that ) the Spirit of Aloha inhabiteth in you ?
58010019	Faith	We have , therefore , my brethren , confidence to enter the holy place through the blood of Jeshu ;
43008021	Sin	Jeshu said again , I go , and you will seek me , and will die in your sins ; and where I go you cannot come .
51003012	Recommendation	Wear , therefore , as the chosen of Aloha , saints and beloved , compassions and tenderness , and benignity , and lowliness of mind , and composure , and patience .
43012026	Faith	If any man serve me , let him come after me ; and where I am , there shall be also my servant : whoever serveth me , him will my Father honour .
54003004	Description	and ( one who ) ruleth his house well , holding his children in subjection with all purity .
52005011	Recommendation	Wherefore comfort one another , and edify one another , as also you do .
62003011	Recommendation	For this is the commandment which you have heard from before , that you love one another .
46007026	Recommendation	And I consider that this is good , on account of the necessity of the time , that it is expedient for a man so to be .
43003001	Description	But there was one of the Pharishee whose name was Nikodimos , a ruler of the Jihudoyee :
59002025	Description	So also Rachab the harlot , was she not by works justified when she received the spies , and by another way sent them forth ?
54002015	Faith	But she is saved by her children , if they continue in faith , and in love , and in sanctification , and in chastity .
44013017	Grace	Men , sons of Israel , and those who fear Aloha , hearken ! The God of this people elected our fathers , and exalted and magnified them , when they were sojourners in the land of Metsreen , and with uplifted arm brought them out therefrom
44015008	Grace	And Aloha , who knoweth what is in the hearts , testified of them , and gave them the Spirit of Holiness , as to us .
59002011	Sin	For he who hath said , Thou shalt not commit adultery , is he who hath said , Thou shalt not steal ; but if thou do not commit adultery , yet steal , thou hast become a transgressor against the LAW .
43010028	Grace	and I give to them the life which is eternal , and they shall not perish for ever , and no man shall snatch them from my hands .
45016020	Grace	But the God of peace will soon bruise Satana beneath your feet . The grace of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha be with you !
55003005	Sin	having a form of the worship of Aloha , but from the power of Aloha afar off : ( them ) who are such put from thee .
45012005	Description	so also we who are many are one body in the Meshiha ; but we are each of us members one of another .
56003008	Faith	Faithful is the word ; and in this I will that thou also establish them , that they should be careful to perform good works , they who have believed in Aloha . These are good and profitable unto men .
59002023	Faith	and the scripture was accomplished which said , that Abraham believed in Aloha , and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness , and the friend of Aloha he was called .
59002001	Faith	My brethren , do not hold with acceptance of faces the faith of the glory of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha .
45003013	Sin	Open sepulchres are their throats , Their tongues have deceived , And the venom of asps is under their lips .
49005028	Recommendation	So it becometh husbands to love their wives , as their own bodies . For he who his wife loveth , himself he loveth .
45009030	Faith	WHAT then shall we say ? That the Gentiles who have not followed after righteousness have attained righteousness , but that righteousness which is of faith :
54003009	Faith	But they shall hold the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience .
54006002	Recommendation	But let not those who have believing masters slight them , because they are their brethren ; but serve them the more , because they are believers , and beloved who are refreshed by their ministry . These things teach and require of them .
45003003	Faith	For if some of them believed not , would their unbelief abolish the faithfulness of Aloha ?
43019034	Violence	But one of the soldiers struck him in his side with the lance , and forthwith there came out blood and water .
43015012	Recommendation	This is my commandment , That you love one another , as I have loved you .

58010039	Faith	But we are not of the weariness which bringeth to perdition , but of the faith which maketh us to possess our soul .
45011026	Grace	and then all Israel shall be saved . As it is written , The Redeemer shall come from Sion , And turn iniquity from Jakub ;
52002015	Violence	who killed our Lord Jeshu Meshiha , and the prophets who were of them , and ourselves have persecuted , and Aloha have not pleased ,
58010026	Sin	For if with his will any man shall sin after he hath received the knowledge of the truth , there is not still a victim to be offered for sins ;
49002006	Grace	and raised us with him , and made us to sit with him in heaven in Jeshu the Meshiha ,
49004025	Recommendation	WHEREFORE let lying cease from you , and speak the truth every man with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .

45006012	Sin	Let not sin then reign in your dead body , as that you may obey the lusts of it :
53003012	Recommendation	But these we command , and entreat of them by our Lord Jeshu Meshiha , that with quietness they work , and eat their ( own ) bread .
44007009	Sin	And these our fathers were incited against Jauseph , and sold him into Mitsreen . And Aloha was with him :
44011028	Description	And one of them arose whose name was Agabos : and he made known to them by the Spirit that a great famine would be in all the land . And that famine was in the days of Claudios Caesar .
44020036	Description	And when these he had said , he kneeled on his knees and prayed , and all the men with him .
48005024	Faith	But they who are of the Meshiha have crucified their flesh , with all its passions and its lusts :

62001006	Sin	And if we say that we have communion with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and in the truth do not proceed ;

54001018	Recommendation	This commandment I commit to thee , my son Timotheos , according to the early prophecies which were concerning thee , that thou mayest war through them this good warfare with faith and with a good conscience .
66019001	Faith	AFTER these I heard a great voice of a multitudinous host in heaven , saying , Halleluia ! Salvation , and power , and glory , and honour , Be unto our God .
49002001	Grace	You also who were dead in your sins and in your transgressions ,
46010021	Sin	You cannot drink the cup of our Lord , and the cup of demons ; and you cannot participate in the table of our Lord , and in the table of demons .
49005003	Recommendation	BUT fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness , let them not be even heard among you , as it becometh the saints ;
56001015	Sin	For every thing is pure to the pure ; but to those who are polluted and unfaithful nothing is pure ; but their understanding and their conscience are polluted .
44009021	Description	And all they who heard him wondered , and they said , Is not this he who persecuted all those who call upon this name in Urishlem ? And behold , also , hither upon the self-same ( object ) was he sent to bind and take them to the chief priests .

62005020	Faith	And we know that the Son of Aloha hath come , and hath given us knowledge to know the truth , and to be in him in the truth , in his Son Jeshu the Meshiha . This is Aloha the true , and the life which is eternal .

58010023	Faith	and let us persevere in the confession of our hope , and not swerve ; for faithful is He who hath promised us .
43014027	Grace	PEACE I leave with you ; my peace I give to you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , nor be afraid .
47005006	Faith	For therefore do we know and are persuaded , that so long as we remain in the body we are in pilgrimage from our Lord .

53003010	Recommendation	For while we were with you , this we commanded you , that every one who willeth not to work , neither should he eat .
43003016	Grace	For so loved Aloha the world , as his Son , the Only-begotten , he would give , that every one who believeth in him might not perish , but have the life which is eternal .

44011017	Grace	If then Aloha equally hath given the gift to the Gentiles who have believed in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha as we , who was I , that I should be sufficient to prohibit Aloha ?
49004030	Faith	And grieve not the Holy Spirit of Aloha , by whom you have been sealed unto the day of redemption .
66003003	Recommendation	Remember then how thou hast received , and hearken , and keep , and repent . And if then thou wilt not awake , I will come against thee as the thief , and thou shalt not know in what hour I come against thee .
62003007	Recommendation	My sons , let no man deceive you : he who worketh righteousness is righteous , as also the Meshiha himself is righteous .
62004001	Recommendation	MY beloved , believe not all spirits , but discern the spirits whether they be from Aloha ; because many false prophets have gone forth into the world .
44013038	Grace	Know then , brethren , that through This himself is preached to you the remission of sins ;
50003001	Recommendation	HENCEFORTH , my brethren , rejoice in our Lord . To write the very same ( things ) to you , to me is not weariness , because they make you cautious .
46011034	Recommendation	But whoever hungereth , in his ( own ) house let him feed ; that you may not assemble unto condemnation . Concerning the rest , when I come I will direct you .
43018031	Description	Pilatos saith to them , Take you him , and judge him according to your law .
46012031	Faith	But if you are emulous of great gifts , I will yet show you a way more admirable .
58007026	Description	For such an High Priest as this was adequate for us ; pure , and without evil , and without spot ; who was separate from sins , and exalted higher than heaven .
50004013	Faith	for every thing I am empowered through the Meshiha who strengtheneth me .
52004003	Recommendation	For this is the will of Aloha , your sanctification ; and that you be distant from all fornication ;
51004002	Recommendation	In prayer be constant , and be watchful in it , and ( in ) giving thanks ;
44007029	Description	And Musha fled at that word , and became a sojourner in the land of Median , and there were to him two sons .
46011007	Description	For a man is not obligated to cover his head , because he is the likeness and the glory of Aloha ; but woman is the glory of man .
51003015	Faith	And let the peace of the Meshiha direct your hearts , for to it you have been called in one body ; and give thanks to the Meshiha ,
58002010	Grace	For it was proper to him by whose hand are all , and on account of whom all are , ( and who ) would lead many sons to his glory , that the Prince of their salvation by sufferings should be perfected .
59004001	Sin	From whence are there among you wars and strifes ? Is it not from the lusts which war in your members ?
46005001	Sin	Fornication is commonly reported among you ; and such fornication as is not heard among the Heathens , that the son should take the wife of his father .
46010013	Faith	Temptation cometh not ( upon ) you but what cometh on mankind ; but faithful is Aloha , who will not permit you to be tempted more than you are able , but will make to your temptation a departure , that you may be able to endure .
44020029	Violence	For I know that after I shall have gone , there will enter with you furious wolves which will not spare the flock .
53001004	Faith	as that we also boast of you in the churches of Aloha , of your faith and of your patience , in all your persecution and your affliction which you endure ;
62004012	Faith	Aloha no man hath seen but if we love one another , Aloha in us abideth , and his love is fulfilled in us .
48001001	Description	Paulos , an apostle , not from men , nor by men , but by Jeshu the Meshiha , and Aloha his Father , who raised him from among the dead ,
58012003	Recommendation	Consider , therefore , how much he endured from sinners who were adversaries to themselves , that ye weary not , nor fail in your souls .
45006005	Faith	For if together we have been planted with him in the likeness of his death , so also in his resurrection shall we be .
45015010	Recommendation	And again he hath said , Be glad , ye Gentiles , with his people .
54004001	Sin	But the Spirit distinctly saith , that in the last times some will remove from the faith , and will go after deceiving spirits , and after doctrines of demons .
56003001	Recommendation	Put them in mind that to princes and to powers they are to hearken and to be obedient , and to be prepared for every good work .
61003005	Sin	Unknown to them is this while they are willing , that the heaven was from of old , and the earth from the waters and through the waters subsisted , by the word of Aloha :
60003018	Grace	Because the Meshiha also once died on account of sins , the just on account of sinners , that he might bring us unto Aloha . And dead in the body and alive in the Spirit ,
61002021	Sin	For it had been more tolerable for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , when they knew , to turn backward from the holy commandment delivered to them .
53003006	Recommendation	But we command you , my brethren , in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha , that you remove from every brother who walketh wickedly , and not according to the precepts which he hath received from us .
45005012	Sin	As by one man sin entered into the world , and by sin death , so death hath passed upon all men through this , that all have sinned .
58011033	Faith	they who through faith conquered kingdoms , and wrought righteousness , and received promises , and shut the mouths of lions ,
47004009	Faith	persecuted , yet not forsaken ; cast down , yet we perish not .
59004004	Sin	Adulterers , know you not that the friendship of this world is enmity with Aloha ? He , therefore , who willeth to be the friend of this world , hath become the enemy of Aloha .
44016006	Description	But they went through the countries of Phrygia and Galatia ; and the Spirit of Holiness forbad them , that they should not preach the word of Aloha in Asia .
45010006	Faith	But the righteousness which is by faith thus speaketh , Say not in thy heart , Who shall ascend into heaven , And bring down the Meshiha ?
66016002	Violence	And the first went , and poured his vial upon the earth : and there became an ulcer , evil and painful , upon the men who had the mark of the beast of prey , and who worshipped the image of him .
66005008	Description	And when he had taken the book , the four living-ones and the twenty and four presbyters fell down before the Lamb , having each of them an harp , and vials of gold full of perfumes , which are the prayers of the saints .
62005001	Faith	WHOSOEVER believeth that Jeshu is the Meshiha of Aloha is born . And every one who loveth the Generator loveth also him who is generated of him .
48005026	Recommendation	and let us not be vain-glorious , contemning one another , envying one another .
54005001	Recommendation	An elder do not reprimand , but persuade him as a father , and those who are young as thy brethren ,
60002012	Recommendation	And let your conversation be good before all men ; and they who speak against you malicious words shall see your good deeds , and shall glorify Aloha in the day of the probation .
50003006	Sin	in zeal , a persecutor of the church ; and in the righteousness of the law , without fault have I been .
43004052	Description	And he asked at what time he was healed . They say to him , Yesterday , at seven hours , the fever left him .
43019031	Violence	THE Jihudoyee , because it was the preparation , said , Let not these bodies remain-all-night upon the cross , because the shabath has lighted : for a great day was the day of that shabath . And they besought of Pilatos that they should break the legs of those ( who had been ) crucified , and take them down .
43019012	Description	On this account Pilatos willed to release him : but the Jihudoyee cried out , If this ( man ) thou releasest , thou art not the friend of Cesar : for whosoever maketh himself a king is the adversary of Cesar .
43014001	Faith	LET not your heart be troubled : believe in Aloha , and in me believe .
50001028	Faith	in nothing moved by them who stand against us , to the forthshowing of their perdition , and of our salvation ,
43015016	Grace	You have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and placed you , that you also may go ( and ) yield much fruit ; and your fruit shall remain , because all that you shall ask the Father in my name , he will give to you .
58011004	Faith	By faith Habel offered a sacrifice which was far better than that of Koen unto Aloha ; and because of it there is respecting him a testimony that he was righteous ; and Aloha gave witness concerning his oblation ; and on account thereof also while dead he is speaking .
46004001	Recommendation	Thus let us be accounted of you as ministers of the Meshiha , and stewards of the mysteries of Aloha .
66006013	Description	and the stars of heaven fell to the earth , as the fig-tree casteth her figs , when from a great wind she is shaken .
46010014	Recommendation	WHEREFORE , my beloved , flee from the worship of idols .
45012021	Recommendation	Let not evil overcome you , but overcome evil with good .
55002014	Recommendation	Of these ( truths ) remind them , and testify before our Lord , that they contend not with unprofitable words , to the overturning of those who hear them .
59004008	Recommendation	and draw nigh unto Aloha , and he will be nigh you . Purify your hands , sinners , and sanctify your hearts , divided of soul .
59002009	Sin	but if you accept persons , you commit sin , and are convicted by the law as transgressors against the law .
52004007	Grace	For Aloha hath not called us to uncleanness , but unto sanctification .
45001018	Sin	For the wrath of Aloha is revealed from heaven against all the unrighteousness and depravity of the sons of men , who the truth in unrighteousness detain .
62004007	Faith	my beloved , let us love one another , because love is of Aloha ; and every one who loveth from Aloha is born , and knoweth Aloha .
62002009	Sin	Whoever saith , then , that he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness until now .
60004014	Grace	And if you be reviled for the sake of the name of the Meshiha , you are happy ; for the Spirit of the glory of Aloha resteth upon you .
44021019	Grace	And we gave them salutation . And Paulos recounted to them in order what Aloha had done among the Gentiles by his ministry .
43008046	Sin	Who of you convicteth me of sin ? Yet if the truth I speak , why do you not believe me ?
58010017	Grace	and their iniquity and their sins I will not remember against them .
46001005	Grace	because in every thing you are enriched in him in all utterance and in all knowledge ,
45015030	Recommendation	Now I entreat of you , my brethren , by our Lord Jeshu Meshiha , and by the love of the Spirit , to labour with me in prayer on my behalf , with Aloha ,
43007020	Violence	The people answered , saying , Thou hast a demon : who seeketh to kill thee ?
45003025	Grace	whom Aloha before ordained ( to be ) a propitiation through faith in his blood for our sins which from the first we had sinned , within the space which Aloha hath given to us in his patience ,
43018018	Description	And the servants and officials were standing , and they had set a fire to warm them , because it was cold ; and Shemun stood also with them and warmed himself .
49006011	Recommendation	And clothe you in all the armour of Aloha , that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the accuser .
43013037	Faith	Shemun Kipha saith to him , My Lord , why cannot I come after thee now ? My life for thee lay I down .
50004007	Faith	And the peace of Aloha , which is greater than all knowledge , shall keep your hearts and your minds , through Jeshu Meshiha .
59003009	Faith	For by it we bless the Lord and the Father , and by it we curse men who in the likeness of Aloha were made ;
46005010	Sin	but I do not say with fornicators who are in this world , nor speak I concerning the covetous , or the rapacious , or the servers of idols ; otherwise you would be obligated from the world also to go forth .
44026009	Sin	For I , at the first , proposed in my mind to do many things against the name of Jeshu Natsroya .
61002014	Sin	having eyes full of adultery , and sins which cease not , alluring souls that are not established . An heart have they which is disciplined in covetousness ; sons of malediction ,
43010012	Description	The hireling who is not the shepherd , and whose the sheep are not , when he seeth the wolf coming , leaveth the flock and fleeth ; and the wolf cometh ravaging and destroying the flock .
59001019	Recommendation	And you , my beloved brethren , let every one of you be swift to hear , and slow to speak , and slow to be angry ;
46009014	Recommendation	So also our Lord hath commanded , that they who his gospel preach , by his gospel shall live .
43012046	Grace	I the light am come into the world , that every one who believeth in me might not abide in darkness .
43005014	Description	After a time Jeshu found him in the temple , and said to him , Behold , thou art healed : sin not again , lest there be to thee that which is worse than the first .
46016014	Recommendation	And let all your affairs be done in love .
43014015	Recommendation	IF you love me , keep my commandments ;
58012025	Recommendation	Beware , therefore , lest ye be averse from Him who hath spoken with you ; for if they escaped not who were averse from one who spake with them on earth , how much less we , if we withdraw from one who hath spoken to us from heaven ?
48004008	Sin	For , while not knowing Aloha , you served them who by their nature are not gods :
44003026	Grace	with you from the first he hath established ; and Aloha hath sent his Son , blessing you , if you will return and repent of your iniquities .
44010039	Violence	And we are his witnesses of all which he did in the land of Jihud and of Urishlem . This ( one ) himself did the Jihudoyee hang upon the tree and kill ;
46001010	Recommendation	But I beseech of you , my brethren , in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha , that you have all one doctrine , and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfect in one mind and one sentiment .
51001021	Sin	YOU also , who before were aliens and adversaries in your minds by your evil works ,
55002022	Recommendation	From all the lusts of youth escape ; and pursue after righteousness , and faith , and charity , and peace , with them who call upon the Lord with a pure heart .
51003001	Faith	IF , then , you have risen with the Meshiha , seek ( the realities ) which are on high , where the Meshiha sitteth at the right hand of Aloha .
66008007	Violence	And there was hail , and fire mingled with the waters , and they were cast upon the earth ; and the third of the earth burned , and the third of the trees burned , and every green herb burned .
66011017	Faith	saying , We give thanks to thee , Lord God omnipotent , Who art , and who wast ; Because thou hast taken thy great power , And hast reigned .
43004010	Grace	Jeshu answered and said to her , If thou hadst known the gift of Aloha , and who He is who hath said to thee , Give me to drink , thou wouldst have asked of him , and he had given thee living waters .
51003004	Grace	and when the Meshiha , who is our life , shall be manifested , then also will you be manifested with him in glory .
43020031	Faith	but these are written , that you may believe that Jeshu is the Meshicha , the Son of Aloha , and that when you have believed you may have in his name the life which is eternal .
62004006	Faith	and he who is not of Aloha heareth us not . In this itself we perceive the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception .
65001012	Description	These are they who , in their recreations contaminating , behave wantonly , feeding themselves without reverence ; clouds without rain , roaming with the winds ; trees whose fruit withereth , and which are unfruitful , twice dead , and uplifted from their root ;
44005015	Description	so that into the streets they brought forth the diseased lying on beds , that , when Shemun should come , even his shadow might overshadow them .
49006016	Faith	and with these take to you the shield of faith , that therewith you may be empowered with strength to extinguish all the burning shafts of that evil one ;
51003023	Recommendation	And all that you do , from all your heart do ( it ) , as to our Lord , and not as to men .
58012016	Recommendation	or lest there be found among you any fornicator , or dissolute , as Isu , who for one meal sold his birthright .
43018040	Sin	And they all cried and said , Not this , but Bar Aba . Now this Bar Aba was a robber .
55003004	Sin	traitors , impetuous , puffed up , lovers of lusts rather than the love of Aloha ;
50002009	Grace	Wherefore also Aloha greatly exalted him , and gave him a name that is more excellent than all names ,
61001016	Description	For it is not after fables which are made with art that we have gone , in making known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha , but as we were spectators of his majesty .
61003016	Sin	As in all his epistles he speaks concerning these ; in which there is somewhat difficult for intelligence . Those who are not knowing nor settled pervert them , as also the remaining scriptures , to their perdition .
44014014	Description	But Bar Naba and Paulos , when they heard , rent their garments , and sprang up , and came out to the crowd . And they cried ,
45015008	Faith	But I say that Jeshu Meshiha ministered the circumcision , on behalf of the truth of Aloha , that he might confirm the promise of the fathers ,
59001026	Sin	And if a man thinketh that he serveth Aloha , and holdeth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , of this man his service is vain .
43015020	Recommendation	Remember the word which I spake with you , That there is no servant who is greater than his lord . If me they have persecuted , you also will they persecute ; and if my word they had kept , yours also would they keep .
43008031	Faith	And Jeshu said to those Jihudoyee who believed on him , If you persevere in my doctrine , you shall be truly my disciples ;
44007011	Description	AND there was a famine and great affliction in all Mitsreen , and in the land of Kenaan , and our fathers had nothing to satisfy them .
63001004	Faith	I have rejoiced much to have found of thy sons who walk in the truth , after the commandment we have received from the Father .
54005008	Faith	For if a man hath not care of them who are his own , and especially of them who are children of the household of faith , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than those who believe not .
58010022	Faith	Let us , therefore , draw near with a confirmed heart , and the full security of faith , with our hearts sprinkled and cleansed from an evil conscience , and our body washed with pure waters ;
48001023	Description	But this only they had heard , that he who had formerly persecuted us , behold , now preacheth he that faith which he beforetime had overthrown .
44027034	Recommendation	Wherefore I beseech you receive meat for the establishment of your lives ; for a hair of the head of one of you will not perish .
66002003	Faith	And thou hast patience , and hast laboured on account of my name , and hast not fainted .
56002002	Recommendation	and teach , That the elders be watchful in their minds , and be chaste and pure , and sound in the faith , and in charity , and in patience .
44017030	Recommendation	For the times of error Aloha hath made to pass away ; and in this time he commandeth all men , that every man in every place should repent ;
43019025	Description	They divided my garments among them , And upon my raiment did they cast the lot . These things did the soldiers . But there stood by the cross of Jeshu his mother , and the sister of his mother , and Mariam , she who was ( the wife ) of Cleopha , and Mariam Magdalitha .
66019013	Description	And he was arrayed in a vestment sprinkled with blood , and his name was called The Word of Aloha .
46008009	Recommendation	But beware that this your power become not a stumbling-block to the infirm ones .
44013034	Grace	And thus did Aloha raise him from among the dead , that again he should not return thither to see corruption ; as he had said , I will give you the sure grace of David .
43014020	Faith	In that day you will know that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
62002003	Faith	And by this we feel that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
43008024	Sin	but I am not of this world . I said to you , that you will die in your sins : for if you believe not that I AM , you will die in your sins .
66017006	Sin	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jeshu ; and I wondered , when I saw , with great wonder .
58012017	Description	For ye know , also , that afterward he desired to inherit the blessing , but was rejected ; for place for repentance he found not , though with tears he sought it .
43007012	Description	and there was great murmuring concerning him among the people ; for some said that he was good , and others said , No ; but he deceiveth the people .
44011021	Faith	And the hand of the Lord was with them , and many believed , and were converted unto the Lord .
52002004	Faith	but as approved of Aloha to be intrusted with his gospel , so speaking as not to please men , but Aloha who trieth our hearts .
46015057	Grace	But thanks be to Aloha , who giveth us the victory by the hand of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha .
54005005	Faith	But she who is truly a widow and solitary ( is one ) whose hope is in Aloha , and who persevereth in prayer and in supplication by night and by day .
43016024	Grace	Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name : ask , and receive , that your joy may be full .
46007021	Recommendation	If a servant thou wast called , be not careful , but , if also thou canst be made free , choose that thou shouldest serve .
65001019	Sin	These are they who separate ; - animals , in whom the Spirit is not .
48001006	Sin	I am amazed how soon you have been turned from the Meshiha himself , who called you by his grace ,
58012014	Recommendation	Follow after peace with every man , and after holiness , without which man our Lord seeth not .
43021006	Description	He saith to them , Cast your net on the right side of the vessel , and you shall find . And they cast ( it ) , and could not draw the net for the multitude of fishes which it held .
46007019	Recommendation	For circumcision is not any thing , nor uncircumcision , but the observances of the commandments of Aloha .
45012008	Recommendation	he who is an exhorter , in his exhorting ; as he who giveth , ( let him give with simplicity ; ) and he who presideth , ( let it be ) with diligence ; and he who ( is engaged in works ) of mercy , with cheerfulness .
44019002	Faith	Have you received the Spirit of Holiness from that you believed ? They answered and said to him , It hath not been heard by us whether there be the Spirit .
53003014	Recommendation	And if any man hearken not to these our words in the epistle , let this be separate from you , and be not mixed with him , that he be shamed .
46015050	Sin	But this I say , my brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven ; nor doth corruption inherit incorruption .
43006027	Recommendation	Work not ( for ) the food which perisheth , but ( for ) the food that endureth unto the life that is eternal , which the Son of man shall give to you : for this hath the Father sealed , ( even ) Aloha .
59004003	Sin	you ask and receive not , because you ask wickedly , as that you may cherish your lusts .
49005020	Faith	And give thanks always on behalf of every man in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha unto Aloha the Father .
48003006	Faith	As Abraham believed Aloha , and it was reckoned to him for righteousness ,
66021023	Grace	And the city hath no need of the sun nor of the moon to enlighten it ; for the glory of Aloha illuminateth it , and the light thereof is the Lamb .
45008009	Faith	But you are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if truly the Spirit of Aloha dwelleth in you . But if a man have not the Spirit of the Meshiha , this ( man ) is not his .
45011023	Faith	And they , if they continue not in their want of faith , they also shall be engrafted ; for Aloha is able again to engraft them .
66014005	Description	And in their mouth falsehood was not found , for they are without spot .
44024014	Faith	Nevertheless , this do I confess , that in that very doctrine of which they speak , in it serve I the God of my fathers , believing in all that is written in the law and in the prophets ,
45013008	Recommendation	And to no man owe any thing , but one another to love . For whoever loveth his neighbour fulfilleth the law :
66016009	Sin	and men were scorched with great heat ; and men blasphemed the name of Aloha who hath power over these plagues ; and they repented not to give him glory .
66021012	Description	having a wall great and high , which had twelve gates , and names written upon them , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel .
48003013	Grace	But us hath the Meshiha bought from the curse of the law , and hath been made a curse instead of us : for it is written , Accursed is every one who is hanged on the wood :
48001013	Sin	For you have heard of my former manners in Judaism , that I exceedingly persecuted the church of Aloha , and made it desolate .
66020002	Description	And he laid hold of the dragon , that ancient serpent , who is the deceiver , and Satana , who seduced all the habitable world , and bound him a thousand years ;

50003010	Faith	that in it I may know Jeshu , and the power of his resurrection , and have fellowship in his sufferings , and be conformed into his death ,
54005022	Recommendation	The hand suddenly on any man lay not , neither participate in others' sins . Keep thyself in purity .
56002003	Recommendation	And so also the aged women , that they be in behaviour what becometh the fear of Aloha , and not slanderers , nor enslaved to much wine , and that they teach good things ;
46007038	Recommendation	And he then who giveth his virgin doeth well , and he who giveth not his virgin doeth better .
59001022	Recommendation	BUT be doers of the word , and not hearers only , neither deceive yourselves .
43007001	Violence	AFTER these Jeshu walked in Galila ; for he would not walk in Jihuda , because the Jihudoyee had sought to kill him .
46001030	Grace	But you are of him in Jeshu Meshiha , who hath been made unto us wisdom , of Aloha , and righteousness and sanctification and redemption ;
43013005	Description	and he poured water into a basin , and began to wash the feet of his disciples , and wiped ( them ) with the towel that he had bound upon his loins .
44022004	Violence	And this way I persecuted unto the death , while I bound and delivered to the house of the bound both men and women ;
43007043	Description	And there was a division concerning him among the assemblies ;
60005002	Recommendation	feed the flock of Aloha which is delivered to you , and take care ( of it ) spiritually , not by constraint , but with the will ; not for corrupt gain , but with all your heart ;
46015056	Sin	But the sting of death is sin , and the strength of sin is the law .
59005004	Sin	Lo , the hire of the labourers who have reaped your lands , which you have refused , clamoureth , and the cry of the harvests to the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth hath ascended .
60002001	Recommendation	MAKE to cease therefore from you all malice and all guile , and dissimulation , and envy , and slander ;

60001010	Grace	That salvation which the prophets investigated when they prophesied concerning the grace which was to be given unto you ,
63001007	Sin	Because many deceivers are come out into the world who confess not that Jeshu Meshiha came in the flesh . This is the deceiver and antichrist .
44024005	Sin	For we have found this man to be a destroyer , and an exciter of agitation among all the Jihudoyee , and in all the land : for he is a chief of the doctrine of the Natsroyee ,

47001005	Grace	For as the sufferings of the Meshiha abound in us , so , through the Meshiha , our consolation aboundeth also .
65001011	Sin	Woe to them ; for in the way of Koen they have gone , and after the error of Belam for gain they have burned , and in the rebellion of Kurach they have perished .
65001010	Sin	But these the things which they know not revile ; but through those by which naturally as the beasts they are swayed , they are corrupted .
58011007	Faith	By faith Nuch , when spoken with upon those things which had not been seen , feared , and made him the ark for the salvation of his family ; by which he condemned the world , and was an heir of the righteousness which is by faith .

59005001	Recommendation	O rich men , howl and weep for the miseries which are coming upon you .
66002010	Recommendation	Fear not any thing of those that thou art to suffer ; for , behold , it will be that the accuser will cast some of you into prison , so that you may be tried ; and you will have affliction ten days . Be faithful unto the death , and I will give thee the crown of life .

44010015	Recommendation	And again the second time was to him , Those ( things ) which Aloha cleanseth make not thou profane .
66018009	Sin	And the kings of the earth who with her have committed fornication , and have been wanton , shall weep and lament and wail over her , when they see the smoke of her burning ;
43014023	Faith	Jeshu replied , and said to him , He who loveth me , my word keepeth , and my Father will love him , and unto him we come , and a dwelling-place with him we make .
62004010	Grace	In this is love : it was not that we had loved Aloha , but that Aloha himself loved us , and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins .

43010033	Sin	The Jihudoyee say to him , Not on account of the good works do we stone thee , but because thou blasphemest ; thou , being a son of man , making thyself Aloha .
66014011	Description	And the smoke of their torment For ever and ever will ascend . And they have no rest day and night Who worship the beast of prey and his image .

45014003	Recommendation	But let not him who eateth despise him who eateth not ; and he who eateth not , let him not judge him who eateth ; for Aloha hath received him .

56001016	Sin	And they profess to know Aloha , but in their works they deny him , and are abominable and disobedient , and reprobate to every good work .
45010002	Faith	For I testify of them that they have zeal for Aloha , but not in knowledge .

60003015	Recommendation	But sanctify in your hearts the Lord Meshiha . AND be prepared to make defence to every one who shall seek of you speech concerning the hope of the faith , with meekness and with seriousness , while you have a good conscience ;
44007033	Recommendation	And the Lord said to him , Loose thy sandals from thy feet : for the ground on which thou standest is holy .
62002024	Faith	And you , what you have heard from the first , let it continue with you . For , if what you have heard from the first continue with you , you also will continue in the Father and in the Son .
43008051	Faith	Amen , amen , I say to you , That he who my word keepeth , death shall not see for ever .
66020011	Description	And I saw a great white throne , and Him who sat thereon , from whom from his face fled earth and heaven ; and place ( as ) to this was not found for them .
46006013	Recommendation	Food is for the belly , and the belly for food ; but Aloha will abolish them both . But the body was not for fornication , but for our Lord , and our Lord for the body .
45006011	Faith	so also reckon yourselves to be dead unto sin , and alive unto Aloha by our Lord Jeshu Meshiha .
47002014	Faith	But thanks unto Aloha , who in all time maketh us a triumph in the Meshiha , and maketh manifest by us the perfume of his knowledge in every place .
62001005	Grace	And this is the annunciation which we have heard from him , and announce to you , that Aloha is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
43006037	Grace	Every one whom the Father hath given me , unto me will come ; and him who unto me shall come , I will not cast out .
58013001	Recommendation	Let the love of the brethren continue in you ;
58007025	Grace	And he is able to save for eternity them who approach by him unto Aloha ; for he liveth through all time , and offereth up prayers on their behalf .
43019015	Violence	But they cried out , Take him away , take him away ! crucify him , crucify him ! Pilatos saith to them , Your king shall I crucify ? The chief priests say to him , We have no king but Cesar .
45011005	Grace	So also , at this time , a residue is left by the election of grace .
66017002	Sin	with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and they who dwell in the earth have been made drunk by the wine of her fornication .
45012010	Recommendation	Be tender to your brethren , and love one another , being forward to honour one another .
45008014	Faith	For they who by the Spirit of Aloha are led , they are the sons of Aloha .
66012003	Description	And I saw another sign in heaven ; and behold a great dragon of fire , which had seven heads and ten horns , and upon his heads seven diadems .

54005017	Recommendation	Those presbyters who well conduct themselves shall be worthy of double honour , especially they who labour in the word and in doctrine .
46008007	Sin	But not in every man is this knowledge ; for there are some who in their conscience until now ( believe ) that , with respect to idols , as of that which hath been sacrificed we eat . And because of weakness their conscience is defiled .
43015002	Grace	Every branch which in me giveth not fruits he taketh away ; and that which giveth fruits he cleanseth , that more fruits it may give .
60005003	Recommendation	not as lords of the flock , but that you may be to them a goodly example ;
52004013	Recommendation	BUT I wish you to know , my brethren , that for those who are asleep you should not have sorrow , as the rest of men , who have no hope .

44007020	Description	In that time Musha was born , and was beloved of Aloha , and was brought up three months in the house of his father .
58005002	Grace	and ( is one ) who can humble himself , and suffer with those who know not and err , since he also himself with infirmity is clothed .
45013012	Recommendation	The night now passeth away , and the day hath drawn nigh ; put we away then from us the works of darkness , and let us clothe with the arms of light .
49006009	Recommendation	So you , masters , do likewise to your servants ; forgiving them a fault ; for you know also that your Master is in heaven , and there is no respect of persons with him .
45012015	Recommendation	Rejoice with them who rejoice , and weep with them who weep .
45002005	Sin	Yet , through the hardness of thy unrepenting heart , layest thou up the treasure of wrath for the day of wrath , and the revelation of the just judgment of Aloha ,
44014019	Violence	But there came thither Jihudoyee from Ikanon and from Antiokia , and stirred up against them the people ; and they stoned Paulos , and dragged him out of the city , because they thought that he was dead .
43013021	Description	These said Jeshu , and was agitated in his spirit , and testified , and said , Amen , amen , I say to you , That one of you shall betray me .
48003022	Faith	But the scripture hath included all under sin , that the promise through faith of Jeshu Meshiha might be given to them who believe .
66011007	Violence	And when they shall have completed their testimony , the beast of prey , which ascended from the abyss , will make war against them , and overcome them ,
58003014	Faith	For we are made participators with the Meshiha , if , from the beginning and unto the end , in this very standing we steadfastly persist .
45008010	Faith	And if the Meshiha be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
44007052	Sin	For which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and slain ? they who before announced the coming of the Righteous ; him whom you delivered up and slew .
48005021	Sin	envy , murder , drunkenness , revelling , and all that are like these ; and they who do them , as I told you before , so now I tell you , the kingdom of Aloha do not inherit .
43012036	Faith	While you have the light , believe in the light , that the sons of light you may become . These spake Jeshu , and went ( and ) concealed himself from them .
58003002	Faith	who was faithful to him who made him , as ( was ) Musha in all his house .
56003006	Grace	which he shed upon us abundantly , by Jeshu Meshiha our Saviour ;

48006009	Recommendation	And while we do that which is good , let it not weary us ; for the time will be when we shall reap , and it will not weary us .
48002019	Faith	For I by the law to the law am dead , that unto Aloha I may live :

66014004	Description	These are they who with women have not been defiled , for they are virgins . These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goeth . These by Jeshu were redeemed from men , first-fruits unto Aloha and to the Lamb .
66009007	Description	And the likeness of those locusts ( was this ) : they resemble the appearance of horses prepared for battle . And upon their heads ( was ) a crown of the likeness of gold ; and their faces ( were ) as the faces of men .
60002016	Recommendation	As the sons of liberty , yet not as men who make their liberty a veil for their wickedness , but as the servants of Aloha .
54004010	Faith	for on this account we labour and are reproached , because we hope in Aloha the Living , who is the Saviour of all men , and especially of the believers .
58010029	Sin	how much greater punishment , think ye , shall he receive who hath trampled upon the Son of Aloha , and hath counted the blood of the covenant of him by which he had been sanctified as that of every man and hath insulted the Spirit of grace ?
43020021	Grace	Then said Jeshu unto them , Peace ( be ) with you : as my Father sent me , I also send you .
65001016	Sin	These are they who murmur and complain of every thing , while walking according to their own desires ; their mouth speaking portentous things , and extolling persons for the sake of gain .
66006015	Description	and the kings of the earth and great ones , and the chiefs of thousands , and the rich and the mighty ones , and every servant , and every freeman , hid them in the caverns , and in the rocks of the mountains ,
66021008	Sin	But the fearful , and the faithless , and sinners , and the unclean , and murderers , and fornicators , and sorcerers , and servers of idols , and all liars , ( shall have ) their portion in the lake which burneth with fire and sulphur ; which is the second death .

66009008	Description	And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as of lions ;
55002024	Recommendation	But a servant of the Lord oweth not to strive , but to be gentle towards every man , and teaching , and long-suffering ,
51002005	Faith	For though in the flesh I am far from you , yet in the spirit I am with you ; and I rejoice to behold your order , and the firmness of your faith in the Meshiha .
60003012	Sin	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous , And his ears , to hear them ; And the face of the Lord is against the wicked .
53002013	Faith	But we are bound to give thanks unto Aloha at all time for you , our brethren , beloved in our Lord , because Aloha hath chosen you from the beginning unto salvation , by sanctification of the Spirit , and by the belief of the truth .
66022011	Recommendation	He who doeth evil shall work evil still ; and he who is filthy shall be filthy still ; and the righteous shall still do righteousness , and the holy be holy still .
44002038	Faith	Shemun saith to them , Repent , and be baptized , every man of you , in the name of the Lord Jeshu , for the remission of sins , and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
52005015	Recommendation	And beware , lest any of you evil render for evil ; but always follow after ( those things which are ) good ( pl . ) toward one another , and toward every man .
45001027	Sin	And also their males likewise left the natural use of their females , and were inflamed with concupiscence one with another , and male with male wrought shamefulness , and the just retribution for their perverseness in themselves received .
50002018	Recommendation	so also you be glad and rejoice with me .

66021025	Description	And the gates of it shall not be shut by day , for night is not there .
43006054	Faith	He who eateth of my body , and drinketh of my blood , hath the life which is eternal , and I will raise him at the last day .
43019011	Sin	Jeshu saith to him , Thou against ME hast no power , no not any , unless it hath been given to thee from above : wherefore he who delivered me to thee hath a sin greater than thine .
59002017	Faith	Thus also the faith that hath not works is dead , ( being ) alone .
45008003	Sin	Because the law was weak through the infirmity of the flesh , Aloha sent his Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin , on account of sin to condemn sin in his flesh ;
60003014	Recommendation	And ( yet ) if you suffer for the sake of righteousness , you are happy . And you will not fear them who would make you afraid , nor be shaken .
51003021	Recommendation	Fathers , exasperate not your children , that they be not discouraged .
66018002	Sin	And he cried with a mighty voice , saying , Fallen , fallen hath Babel the Great , and hath become a den of demons , and the keep of every unclean spirit , and the keep of every unclean and abominable bird , and the keep of every unclean and abominable beast of prey .
62002022	Sin	Who is a liar , if not he who denieth that Jeshu is the Meshiha ? and this ( one ) is a false meshiha . He who denieth the Father , denieth also the Son ;
46011027	Sin	Whoever then eateth of the bread of the Lord , and drinketh of his cup , and is not worthy of it , is guilty of the blood of the Lord and of his body .
59002020	Faith	Art thou willing to know , O weak man , that faith without works is dead ?
43018003	Description	Jihuda then took a band , and from the chief priests and Pharishee he took officers , and came thither with lanterns and lamps and arms .
53003003	Grace	But the Lord is faithful , who will keep you and deliver you from evil .
44007021	Description	And when he was outcast from his people , the daughter of Pherun found him , and brought him up unto her for a son .
66008005	Description	And the angel took the censer , and filled it from the fire of the altar , and cast forth upon the earth . And there were thunders , and lightnings , and voices , and movement .
66018003	Sin	For that of the wine of her rage have all nations drunk ; and the kings of the earth have with her committed fornication , and the merchants of the earth from the power of her luxuriance have become rich .
44026021	Violence	And for these things the Jihudoyee seized me in the temple , and would have killed me ;
55004004	Sin	And from the truth they will turn away their ear , but to fables will decline .
43006064	Faith	But there are some of you who do not believe . For Jeshu knew from the first who they were who believed not , and who it was who would betray him .

54006020	Recommendation	O Timothy , watch over that which is confided to thee , and fly from vain words , and the turnings of false knowledge .
44017005	Violence	And the Jihudoyee envied , and joined to them evil men from the public place of the city , and made a great multitude , and conturbed the city . And they came and stood at the house of Jason , and demanded that they should bring them out from thence and deliver them to the multitude .
62005016	Sin	if a man shall see his brother sin a sin not obnoxious to the death , he shall ask , and life be given to him , to those who sin not as unto the death . For there is the sin of death ; - it is not concerning this I say that a man shall pray .
43013020	Faith	Amen , amen , I say to you , Whoever receiveth him whom I send receiveth me ; and whoever receiveth me receiveth him who sent me .
58012028	Faith	Therefore because we have received the kingdom which is immoveable , let us hold the grace by which we may serve and please Aloha with reverence and with fear :
44019013	Description	BUT men , Jihudoyee , also , who went about and adjured demons , willed to adjure in the name of our Lord Jeshu over those who had unclean spirits , saying , We adjure you in the name of Jeshu whom Paulos preacheth .

63001008	Recommendation	Be watchful of yourselves , that not any thing perish which you have wrought ; but ( that with ) a complete reward you may be recompensed .
66011006	Violence	These have power to shut heaven , that rain it may not rain in those days ; and power have they over the waters , to turn them into blood , and to smite the earth with every plague as many times as they will .
44008021	Sin	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this faith , because thine heart hath not been right before Aloha .
43017010	Faith	And every thing of mine is thine , and thine is mine , and I am glorified in them .
45003012	Sin	All have declined together and are reprobate , And there is none that doeth good , not one .
50002003	Recommendation	And do nothing in contention or vainglorying , but in meekness of mind let a man consider his neighbour as better than himself .
66001013	Description	And in the midst of the candlesticks ( one ) who was like the Son of man , clothed to the foot , and girded about his paps with a circlet of gold .

44014026	Grace	and from thence voyaged by sea and came to Antiokia , because from thence they had been commended to the grace of the Lord for the work which they had accomplished .
46007028	Recommendation	Yet , if thou takest a wife , thou sinnest not ; and if a virgin shall be to a husband , she sinneth not . Yet affliction in the body will be to them who are such ; but I am sparing over you .
49006012	Sin	For your wrestling is not with flesh and blood ( only ) , but with princes , and with powers , and with the possessors of this dark world , and with the evil spirits who are under heaven .
59001005	Recommendation	If any of you be deficient in wisdom , let him ask of Aloha , who giveth to all expansively , and upbraideth not , and it is given to him .
52005019	Recommendation	The Spirit quench not .

43007018	Faith	He who from the will of his ( own ) mind speaketh , the glory of himself seeketh ; but he who the glory of him who hath sent him seeketh , is true , and no iniquity is in him .
47004007	Grace	BUT we have this treasure in a vase of earth , that the greatness of the power might be from Aloha , and not from us .

45014020	Recommendation	and not for the sake of meats undo the work of Aloha . For each thing is pure , yet evil is it to the man who eateth with offence .
43019040	Description	And they took the body of Jeshu , and wrapped it in cloths and in balsams , as is the manner of the Jihudoyee to bury .
58010034	Faith	And it afflicted you on account of them who were bound ; and the pillage of your goods with joy ye sustained , as knowing that ye have a possession in heaven , which is better , and passeth not away .
44013023	Grace	From the seed of this ( man ) the God of Israel , as he had promised , raised up Jeshu the Redeemer .
46002009	Faith	But as it is written , The eye hath not seen , Nor the ear heard , Nor the heart of man hath risen ( to ) , That which Aloha hath prepared for those who love him .
45008011	Grace	And if the Spirit of him who raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead dwell in you , he who raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead will also make alive your dead bodies , on account of his Spirit who dwelleth in you .
45008016	Faith	And the Spirit himself witnesseth with our spirit , that we are the sons of Aloha .
48006007	Recommendation	Do not err . Aloha is not mocked : for whatever a man soweth , that he reapeth .
45011022	Grace	Behold , then , the goodness and the severity of Aloha : towards them who fell , severity ; but towards thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness ; if not , thou also wilt be cut off .
59005007	Recommendation	BUT you , my brethren , prolong your spirit until the coming of the Lord ; as the husbandman who expecteth the precious fruits of his lands , and prolongeth his spirit for them , until he receive the rain the early and the latter ;
55001016	Grace	Our Lord give mercies to the house of Onesiphoros , who many times hath refreshed me , and of the chains of my bonds hath not been ashamed .
62002028	Faith	And now , my sons , continue in him : that when he is manifested we may not he confounded of him , but we may have confidence at his coming .

43010031	Violence	And again the Jihudoyee took up stones to stone him .
46011003	Description	But I would that you know that the Meshiha is the head of every man ; and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of the Meshiha is Aloha .
58011036	Violence	But others went through mockings and scourgings ; others unto chains and imprisonments were given up ,
58006019	Faith	which we have as an anchor that holdeth our soul , that it may not be moved , and entereth within the veil ,
49005011	Recommendation	And have no communion with the works of darkness , which have no fruits , but reprove them .
59004011	Recommendation	Speak not against one another , my brethren ; for he who speaketh against his brother , or judgeth his brother , speaketh against the law , and judgeth the law . And if the law thou judgest , thou art not a doer of the law , but the judge of it .
66021021	Description	And the twelve gates are twelve pearls , each of every one of the gates ( a pearl ) , and each of every one of the pearls ( a gate ) . And the wide street of the city was of pure gold as the brightness of light .

44013021	Description	and then prayed they for themselves a king ; and Aloha gave to them Shaol-bar-Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , forty years .

45003027	Faith	Where , then , is boasting ? It is abolished . By what law ? of works ? No , but by the law of faith .
43014010	Faith	Believest thou not that I am in my Father and my Father in me ? And these words that I speak , I speak not from myself , but my Father who dwelleth in me , he doeth these works .
44016022	Violence	And a great gathering assembled against them . Then the prefects rent their vestments , and commanded to scourge them .
43013034	Recommendation	A new commandment give I to you , that you should love one another ; as I have loved you , so do you also love one another .
47005001	Grace	FOR we know that if our earthly house of this body were dissolved , we have nevertheless a building that is by Aloha ; a house which is not made with hands , in the heaven , eternal .
43012044	Faith	But Jeshu cried and said , He who believeth in me , believeth not in me , but in him who sent me .
44009013	Description	And Hanania said , My Lord , I have heard from many concerning this man , of how much evil he hath brought upon thy saints in Urishlem .
55003002	Sin	and men will be lovers of themselves , and lovers of money , boastful , lofty , blasphemous , to their men not obedient , deniers of grace , impious , calumniators ,
45005009	Grace	how much more , then , shall we be now justified through his blood , and by him be delivered from wrath ?
45014014	Sin	For I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jeshu , that a thing which is unclean from itself is not ( so ) ; but to him who judgeth of any thing that it is polluted , to him only it is polluted .
54004006	Faith	These if thou shalt teach thy brethren , a good minister wilt thou be of Jeshu Meshiha , while thou wilt be enlarged with words of faith and of the good doctrine which thou hast learned .
