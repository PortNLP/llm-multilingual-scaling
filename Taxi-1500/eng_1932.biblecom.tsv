62004012	Faith	No one has ever seen God. However, if we love one another then God lives in us, and his love is fulfilled in us.
48001001	Description	This letter comes from Paul, an apostle not appointed by any human organization or human authority. Quite the contrary: I was appointed by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Jesus from the dead.
58012003	Recommendation	Think about Jesus who endured such hostility from sinful people so you don't grow tired and become discouraged.
45006005	Faith	If we've become one with him in dying like he did, then we'll be raised like him too.
45015010	Recommendation	And also: “Foreigners, celebrate with his people!”
54004001	Sin	However the Spirit very clearly explains that in the last times some will abandon their trust in God, and will listen to deceptive spirits and beliefs that come from demons.
56003001	Recommendation	Remind them to follow what rulers tell them to do, and to obey authorities. They should always be ready to do what is good.
61003005	Sin	But they deliberately ignore the fact that by God's command the heavens were created long ago. The earth came into existence from the water, and was surrounded by water.
60003018	Grace	Jesus died because of sins, once and for all, the One completely true and right for those who are bad, so that he could bring you to God. He was put to death in the body, but he came to life in the spirit.
61002021	Sin	It would have been better not to have known the right way of truth, than to have known it and then turn away from the sacred instructions they'd been given.
53003006	Recommendation	Now we want to tell you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, not to associate with any believer who can't be bothered to work for their living—those who don't follow the teachings they learned from us.
45005012	Sin	For through one man sin entered the world, and sin led to death. In this way death came to everyone, for everyone sinned.
58011033	Faith	Because of their trust in God they conquered kingdoms, did what was right, received God's promises, shut the mouths of lions,
47004009	Faith	We are persecuted, but never abandoned by God. We are knocked down, but not dead yet!
59004004	Sin	You adulterous people! Don't you realize that friendship with the world is hatred towards God? Those who want to be friends of the world make themselves enemies of God.
44016006	Description	They traveled through the districts of Phrygia and Galatia, since the Holy Spirit prevented them from going to the province of Asia to speak the word.
45010006	Faith	But the attitude of doing right that comes from trust says this: “Don't ask ‘who'll go to heaven?’ (asking to bring Christ down),”
66016002	Violence	So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and terrible, painful sores broke out on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.
66005008	Description	When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the believers.

48005026	Recommendation	Let's not become boastful, or irritate and envy one another.
54005001	Recommendation	Don't rebuke a man who is older than you. Instead, encourage him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,
60002012	Recommendation	Be sure to act appropriately when you're with non-Christians, so even if they accuse you of doing wrong, they will see the good things you do and glorify God when he comes.
50003006	Sin	as for religious dedication I was a persecutor of the church; while in regard to doing right according to the law I was blameless!

43019031	Violence	It was preparation day, and the Jewish leaders didn't want to leave the bodies on the crosses during the Sabbath day (in fact this was a special Sabbath), so they asked Pilate to break the legs, so that the bodies could be removed.
43019012	Description	When Pilate heard this he tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders shouted, “If you set this man free you're not Caesar's friend. Anyone who sets himself up as a king is rebelling against Caesar.”
43014001	Faith	“Don't let your minds be anxious. Trust in God, trust in me as well.
50001028	Faith	Don't let your enemies scare you. By being brave you will demonstrate to them that they will be lost, but that God himself will save you.
43015016	Grace	You didn't choose me, I chose you. I have given you the responsibility to go and produce lasting fruit. So the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.
58011004	Faith	By trusting him Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain, and as a result God identified him as someone who lived right. God showed this by accepting his offering. Even though Abel has been dead for a long time, he still speaks to us through what he did.
46004001	Recommendation	So think of us as Christ's servants given the responsibility for “the mysteries of God.”
66006013	Description	The stars of heaven fell to earth like unripe figs falling from a fig tree shaken by a windstorm.
46010014	Recommendation	So my good friends, stay away from idol worship.
45012021	Recommendation	Don't be defeated by evil—conquer evil with good.
55002014	Recommendation	This is what you should remind people about, telling them before God that they shouldn't have meaningless arguments over words. To do this only harms those who listen.
59004008	Recommendation	Come close to God and he will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you people with divided loyalties.
59002009	Sin	But if you show favoritism, you're sinning. The law convicts you as guilty of breaking it.
52004007	Grace	For God did not call us to live impure lives, but holy lives.
45001018	Sin	God's hostility is revealed from heaven against those who are godless and are not right, those who suppress the truth through the evil that they do.
62004007	Faith	Dear friends, let's go on loving one another, for love comes from God. All those who love are born of God and know God.
62002009	Sin	Those who say they live in the light but hate a fellow Christian still have the darkness inside them.

45003025	Grace	God openly presented Jesus as the gift that brings peace to those trusting in him, the one who shed his blood. God did this to demonstrate he is truly right, for previously he would hold back and pass over sins,
43018018	Description	It was cold, and the servants and guards were standing by a fire they had made, warming themselves. Peter went and stood with them, warming himself.

43013037	Faith	“Lord, why can't I follow you now?” Peter asked. “I'll lay down my life for you.”
50004007	Faith	Then the peace that comes from God, which is better than we can ever imagine, will keep your hearts and minds protected in Christ Jesus.
59003009	Faith	We use the same tongue to bless our Lord and Father, as well as to curse people who are made in God's image—
46005010	Sin	I wasn't referring to the immoral people of this world, those who are greedy and cheat others, or those who worship idols, otherwise you'd have to leave this world!
44026009	Sin	Previously I was sincerely convinced I should do as much as I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
61002014	Sin	They're always on the lookout for adulterous relationships—they just can't stop sinning. They seduce the vulnerable; they have trained themselves in greed; they are offspring under a curse.
43010012	Description	The man paid to look after the sheep is not the shepherd and he runs away when he sees the wolf coming. He abandons the sheep because they're not his, and the wolf attacks and scatters the flock

46009014	Recommendation	In just the same way the Lord ordered that those who announce the good news should live from supporters of the good news.

43005014	Description	Later on Jesus found the man in the Temple, and told him, “Look, now you've been healed. So stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”
46016014	Recommendation	Whatever you do, do it in love.
43014015	Recommendation	If you love me, you will keep my commands.
58012025	Recommendation	Make sure you don't reject the one who is speaking! If they didn't escape when they rejected God on earth, it is even more certain that we won't escape if we turn away from God who warns us from heaven!
48004008	Sin	At the time when you didn't know God, you were enslaved by the supposed “gods” of this world.
44003026	Grace	God prepared his Servant and sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your evil ways.”
44010039	Violence	We can testify to all that he did in Judea and Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross.
46001010	Recommendation	Brothers and sisters, I plead with you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all agree and that you're not divided. Instead develop a united attitude and purpose.
51001021	Sin	You once were alienated from God, enemies in the way you thought and the way you acted,
55002022	Recommendation	Run away from anything that fires up the desires of youth. Run after what is right and trustworthy, run after love and peace along with those who are true and pure Christians.
51003001	Faith	So if you've been brought back to life with Christ, look for what comes from above, where Christ is, sitting at God's right hand.
66008007	Violence	The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood rained down on the earth. One third of the earth was burned up, one third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up.

43004010	Grace	Jesus answered her, “If you only recognized God's gift, and who is asking you, ‘Please could you give me a drink?’ you would have asked him and he would have given you the water of life.”
51003004	Grace	When Christ—your life—is revealed, then you will also share in his visible glory.
43020031	Faith	But these are written down here so that you may trust that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by trusting in him as he is you will have life.
62004006	Faith	We belong to God and whoever knows God listens to us, while whoever doesn't belong to God doesn't listen to us. This is how we can distinguish the spirit of truth from the spirit of deception.
65001012	Description	These people spoil your fellowship meals, for they are selfish shepherds that don't have the slightest sense of shame—they only take care of themselves. They're clouds blown along by the wind that bring no rain. They're bare trees without fruit—twice dead, pulled out by the roots.
44005015	Description	As a result, people brought those who were sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that as Peter passed by his shadow might fall on them.
49006016	Faith	Above all, take up the shield of trusting God, by which you'll be able to put out all the devil's flaming arrows.
51003023	Recommendation	Do whatever you do really well, as if you're doing it for God, and not for people,
58012016	Recommendation	Make sure there's nobody who is sexually immoral, or irreligious, like Esau was. He sold his birthright for a single meal.
43018040	Sin	“No, not him! We want Barabbas instead!” they shouted back. Barabbas was a rebel.
55003004	Sin	they will betray others and be totally thoughtless. They are absurdly full of themselves, living so much for pleasure that they don't care about loving God.
50002009	Grace	That's why God placed him in the position of greatest honor and power, and gave him the most prestigious name—
61001016	Description	We didn't follow made-up myths when we told you about the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ—we saw his majesty for ourselves.
61003016	Sin	He spoke about these things, though some of what he wrote is certainly hard to understand. Some ignorant and unbalanced people have twisted what he wrote to their own loss—just as they do other scriptures.
44014014	Description	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul learned what was happening, they tore their clothes, and rushed into the crowds, shouting out,
45015008	Faith	I maintain that Christ came as a servant to the Jews to show God tells the truth, keeping the promises he made to their forefathers.
59001026	Sin	If you think you're religious, but don't control what you say, you deceive yourself—your religion is pointless.
43015020	Recommendation	Remember what I told you: servants aren't more important than their master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you too. If they did what I told them, they will do what you tell them too.

58010022	Faith	let us come close to God with sincere minds, totally trusting in him. Our minds have been sprinkled to purify them from our evil way of thinking, and our bodies have been washed clean by pure water.
48001023	Description	They had only heard people say, “The man who used to persecute us is now spreading the faith he once tried to destroy!”
44027034	Recommendation	“Please do what I say and eat some food. This will help give you strength. For not even a hair from anyone's head is going to be lost!”
66002003	Faith	I know about your patience, and what you endured for my sake—and that you didn't give up!
56002002	Recommendation	Older men shouldn't drink; they should be respectable and sensible, with a healthy trust in God, loving and patient.
44017030	Recommendation	God disregarded people's ignorance in the past, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent.

66019013	Description	He wore a robe covered in blood, and his name is The Word of God.
46008009	Recommendation	Just take care not to use this freedom you have to eat food sacrificed to idols to become offensive to those with a weaker attitude.

62002003	Faith	We can be sure that we do know him if we follow his commands.
43008024	Sin	That is why I told you that you'll die in your sins. For if you don't trust in me, the ‘I am,’ you'll die in your sins.”
66017006	Sin	I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of believers, and on the blood of martyrs who had died for Jesus. When I saw her, I was totally amazed.
58012017	Description	You remember that even when he wanted to receive the blessing later on he was refused. Even though he really tried, and cried hard, Esau couldn't change what he had done.
43007012	Description	Many people in the crowds were complaining about him. Some said, “He's a good man,” while others argued, “No! He deceives people.”
44011021	Faith	The power of the Lord was with them and a large number trusted in the Lord and turned to him.
52002004	Faith	On the contrary, we have God's approval for what we say—he's entrusted us with sharing the good news. We don't set out to please people, but God. He's the one who judges our motives.
46015057	Grace	but praise God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
54005005	Faith	Now a real widow, having no family, alone and without support, puts her hope in God and prays for help night and day.
43016024	Grace	Until now you haven't asked for anything in my name, so ask and you shall receive, and your happiness will be complete.
46007021	Recommendation	If you were a slave when you were called, don't worry—though if you have an opportunity to become free, take it.
65001019	Sin	They cause divisions; they are worldly people who don't have the Spirit.
48001006	Sin	I'm shocked at how quickly you're abandoning the God who by the grace of Christ called you. You are turning to a different kind of good news
58012014	Recommendation	Do your best to live in peace with everybody, and look for holiness—if you don't have this you won't see the Lord.
43021006	Description	“Throw the net out on the right side of the boat, and you'll find some,” he told them. So they threw out the net, and they weren't able to haul it in because it had so many fish.
46007019	Recommendation	Circumcision doesn't mean anything, and uncircumcision doesn't mean anything. Keeping the commandments of God is what really matters.
45012008	Recommendation	if encouragement then you should encourage; if giving then you should give generously; if leadership then you should lead with commitment; if being merciful then you should do so gladly.
44019002	Faith	“Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” he asked them. “No, we haven't heard anything about a Holy Spirit,” they told him.
53003014	Recommendation	Take note of anyone who doesn't do what we're telling you in this letter, and make sure you don't associate with them, so that they may become embarrassed.
46015050	Sin	However, I tell you this, my brothers and sisters: our present bodies cannot inherit the kingdom of God. These decaying bodies cannot inherit what lasts forever.
43006027	Recommendation	Don't be preoccupied about food that doesn't last, but concentrate on the lasting food of eternal life which the Son of man will give you, for God the Father has placed his seal of approval on him.”

49005020	Faith	Always thank God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
48003006	Faith	It's just like Abraham who “trusted God, and was considered to be right.”
66021023	Grace	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it because the glory of God provides its light—the Lamb is its lamp.
45008009	Faith	But you're not following your sinful nature, but the Spirit—if it's true that the Spirit of God is living in you. For those that don't have the Spirit of Christ in them don't belong to him.
45011023	Faith	If they no longer refuse to trust in God, they can be grafted in as well, for God is able to graft them back in again.
66014005	Description	They speak no lies; they are without fault.
44024014	Faith	But I will admit this to you: I serve the God of our fathers following the beliefs of the Way, which they call a heretical sect. I believe everything the law teaches and what is written in the books of the prophets.
45013008	Recommendation	Don't owe anybody anything, except love for one another—for those who love their neighbor have kept the law.
66016009	Sin	They were scorched by intense heat, and they cursed the name of God who controlled these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.

48003013	Grace	Christ has rescued us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. As Scripture says, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”—

54005022	Recommendation	Don't be in a hurry to lay hands on anyone; and don't get involved in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
56002003	Recommendation	Similarly older women ought to behave in a way that shows they live their lives for God. They shouldn't destroy people's reputations by what they say, and they shouldn't be addicted to wine.

59001022	Recommendation	But do what the word says—don't just listen to it and delude yourselves.
43007001	Violence	After this, Jesus spent his time going from place to place in Galilee. He did not want to do so in Judea because the Jews were out to kill him.

43007043	Description	So the crowd had a strong difference of opinion about him.
60005002	Recommendation	Look after God's flock you have been given to care for, watching over it not because you're forced to, but gladly, as God wants you to. Do this willingly, not looking to make a profit from it.
46015056	Sin	The sting that causes death is sin; and the power of sin is the law;
59005004	Sin	Look, the wages of your farm workers that you cheated are crying out against you—the cries of the farm workers have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
60002001	Recommendation	So give up all the evil things that you do: all your dishonesty, hypocrisy, and jealousy, all the ways you speak badly about others.
46007039	Recommendation	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whoever she wants in the Lord.
55002018	Sin	They have deviated from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already happened, which has ruined some people's trust in God.
48005006	Faith	For in Christ Jesus being circumcised or uncircumcised doesn't achieve anything; it's only trust working through love that matters.
58005009	Grace	When his experience was complete, he became the source of eternal salvation to everyone who does what he says,
46016001	Recommendation	Now about “collecting money for fellow-believers.” I'm giving you the same instructions for you to follow as I did to the churches in Galatia.

43008012	Faith	Jesus spoke again to the people, telling them, “I am the light of the world. If you follow me you won't walk in darkness for you will have the life-giving light.”
65001017	Recommendation	But you, my dear friends, please remember what you were told by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44017025	Grace	He doesn't need to be served by us as if he needed anything, since he is the source of all life for every living being.
62005009	Faith	If we accept the evidence that human witnesses provide, then the evidence that God provides is much more important. The evidence that God provides is his testimony about his Son.
45013014	Faith	Instead put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and forget about following your sinful desires.
58011030	Description	Trusting in God, the Israelites marched around the walls of Jericho for seven days, and the walls fell down.

43017026	Grace	I have revealed your character to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love you have for me will be in them, and I will live in them.”
45008032	Grace	God, who did not hold back his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, won't he also freely give us everything?
65001018	Sin	They explained to you that in the last times mockers would come, following their own wicked desires.
45011018	Recommendation	then you shouldn't look down on the other branches. If you're tempted to boast, remember it's not you who are supporting the roots, but the roots that are supporting you.
47001024	Faith	This isn't because we want to dictate how you relate to God, but because we want to help you have a joyful experience—for it's by trusting God that you stand firm.

60003011	Recommendation	Turn away from evil and do good; search for peace—run after it!

56003010	Recommendation	Warn someone who is divisive once, and then again—after that don't pay them any attention,
43010019	Description	The Jews were again divided in their opinion about Jesus over these words.
43003033	Faith	Yet anyone who accepts what he says confirms that God is truthful.

46004016	Recommendation	So I'm pleading with you to imitate me!
46001021	Faith	Since God in his wisdom allowed the world in its wisdom not to know God, it was God's gracious plan that by the foolishness of the good news those who trusted in him would be saved.
60003001	Recommendation	Wives, accept your husbands' authority in the same way, so that if some husbands refuse to accept the word, they may still be won over without words by the way you behave,
47005020	Recommendation	So we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God is pleading through us: “Please, won't you come back and be God's friend?”

50001027	Recommendation	Just be sure that the way you live your lives corresponds to the good news of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or not I can get to hear how you're doing—that you stand firm in full agreement with one another, spiritually united as you work together for the trusting faith of the good news.
46006014	Grace	By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us up the same way.
55001006	Recommendation	That's why I want to remind you to revitalize God's gracious gift to you which you received when I placed my hands on you.

46010010	Recommendation	Don't complain at God, as some did, and died at the hands of the destroying angel.
47002017	Faith	We are not like the majority who trade in the word of God for profit. Quite the opposite: we are sincere in sharing the word of God in Christ, knowing God is watching us.
45015001	Recommendation	Those of us who are spiritually strong ought to support those who are spiritually weak. We shouldn't just please ourselves.
50002024	Faith	and I trust in the Lord that shortly I'll be able to come too.

66011005	Violence	If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies. This is how anyone who tries to harm them will be killed.
44023005	Recommendation	“Brothers, I didn't know that he was the high priest,” Paul replied. “As Scriptures say, ‘You must not speak evil of any ruler of your people.’”
66022015	Sin	Those outside the city are dogs, those who practice witchcraft, those who are sexually immoral, those who murder, those who worship idols, and all those who love and invent lies.
66002014	Sin	But I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak how to entrap the children of Israel by means of eating food sacrificed to idols and committing sexual sins.
53001003	Faith	We keep on thanking God for you, brothers and sisters—we just have to! This is the right thing to do because your trust in God is growing in leaps and bounds, and the love you all have for each other increases more and more.
46012002	Sin	You know that when you were pagans, you were deceived, being led astray by worshiping idols who couldn't even speak.
49005025	Recommendation	Husbands, you should love your wives in the same way as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

43019006	Violence	When the chief priests and the guards saw Jesus, they shouted out, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” “You take him and crucify him,” Pilate answered. “I find him not guilty.”
60001010	Grace	It was this salvation that the prophets searched for and investigated when they spoke of the grace that was prepared for you.
63001007	Sin	I'm telling you this because many deceivers have left and gone out into the world. They don't accept that Jesus Christ has come as a human being. Anyone like this is a deceiver and an antichrist.
44024005	Sin	We discovered that this man is a real pest, stirring up rebellions among Jews all over the world, a ringleader of the Nazarene sect.
54003016	Grace	There's no question about it: the revealed truth about God is amazing! He was made known to us in human form, he was vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, declared to the nations, trusted in by the world, and taken up in glory!

47001005	Grace	The more we share in Christ's sufferings, the more we receive the abundant comfort of Christ.
65001011	Sin	They're in terrible trouble! For they have followed Cain's way. Like Balaam and his delusion, they have abandoned themselves to the profit motive. Like Korah and his rebellion, they have destroyed themselves.
65001010	Sin	But these people ridicule whatever they don't understand; and what they do understand they instinctively follow like unthinking animals—this is what destroys them.
58011007	Faith	Noah trusted God, and was warned by him about things that had never happened before. Because Noah paid serious attention to what God said, he constructed an ark to save his family.

58009006	Description	Once all of this had been set up, the priests would go in regularly to the first room of the tabernacle to perform their duties.
44007051	Sin	You arrogant, hard-hearted people! You never listen! You always fight against the Holy Spirit! You act just like your fathers did!
54001009	Sin	We also know that law isn't laid down for those who do what is right, but for those who are rebellious and ignore the law. It applies to people who have no use for God, who are sinful, who treat nothing as holy and are completely irreligious. It's for those who kill fathers and mothers, for murderers,
46005009	Recommendation	In my previous letter I wrote that you should not associate with immoral people.
48001015	Grace	But when God (who had set me apart from birth) called me through his grace, and was pleased
45007015	Description	I really don't understand what I'm doing. I do the things I don't want to do, and what I hate doing, that's what I do!

46004010	Description	We're Christ's fools, but you are so wise in Christ! We're the weak ones, but you are so strong! You have the glory, but we are despised!

66017012	Description	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not begun to reign yet. However they will be given authority to reign as kings together with the beast for one hour.

66002010	Recommendation	Don't be afraid about what you are going to suffer. Yes, the devil will throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Just remain faithful, even if it means death, and I will give you the crown of life!
54006011	Recommendation	But you as a man of God should run away from such things. You should seek to do what is right, practice true religion, and trust in God. Aim to love, to be patient, and gentle.
59005005	Sin	You've enjoyed a life of luxury here on earth, full of self-indulgent pleasure, fattening yourselves up for the day of slaughter!

60003007	Recommendation	Husbands, in just the same way, be considerate to your wives as you live together with them. Though she may not be as strong as you are, you should honor her since she will inherit equally with you God's gift of life. Make sure to do this so nothing will get in the way of your prayers.
54002012	Recommendation	I don't allow women to be instructors, or to dominate men; let them remain quiet.
46001009	Faith	God is trustworthy who called you to share together in fellowship with his son Jesus Christ our Lord.
48005013	Recommendation	You, my brothers and sisters, were called to freedom! Just don't use your freedom as an excuse to indulge your sinful human nature—instead serve one another in love.

47001021	Faith	God has given both us and you the inner strength to stand firm in Christ. God has appointed us,
44010015	Recommendation	He heard the voice speak again, “Don't you call unclean what God has made clean!”
66018009	Sin	The kings of the earth who had committed adultery with her and indulged their lusts with her will cry and mourn over her when they see the smoke of the fire that destroys her.
43014023	Faith	Jesus replied, “Those who love me will do as I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with them.
62004010	Grace	This is love! It's not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and he sent his Son to be the reconciliation for our sins.
62001007	Faith	But if we are living in the light, as he is in the light, then we share in this friendship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, makes us clean from every sin.
48004007	Grace	Since you are now no longer a slave, but a child, and if you are his child, then God has made you his heir.
58001008	Faith	but about the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, lasts forever and ever, and justice is the ruling scepter of your kingdom.
43010033	Sin	The Jews replied, “We're not stoning you for a good deed, but for blasphemy because you are just a man but you're claiming to be God.”
66014011	Description	The smoke of their anguish ascends for ever and ever. They don't have any relief day or night, those who worship the beast and his image and who receive the mark of his name.”
47004001	Faith	So then, since God in his mercy has given us this new way of relating to him, we don't give up.
58013006	Faith	That's why we can confidently say, “The Lord is the one who helps me, so I won't be afraid. What can anyone do to me?”
45014003	Recommendation	Those who eat anything must not look down on those who won't, and those who won't eat must not criticize those who do—for God has accepted them both.
45015005	Grace	May the God who gives patience and encouragement help you to be in full agreement among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,
58007027	Description	Unlike those human high priests, he doesn't need to offer a daily sacrifice for his sins and then the sins of the people. He did this once, and for everyone, when he offered himself.
62003017	Sin	If one of you is living well in this world and you see your Christian brother or sister in need, but you don't show compassion—how can God's love be living in you?

60002011	Recommendation	My friends, I'm pleading with you as foreigners and strangers in this world not to give in to physical desires that are in conflict with what is spiritual.

44007025	Description	Moses thought his fellow Israelites would see that God was rescuing them through him, but they didn't.
50003002	Violence	Watch out for the wolves, those who do evil, those who insist on physical circumcision—
56001016	Sin	They claim to know God, but they prove this is false by what they do. They are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good.
45010002	Faith	I can testify to their passionate dedication to God, but it's not based on knowing him as he truly is.
47001004	Grace	He comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those who are also in trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.

54005017	Recommendation	Elders who direct the church well should be seen as doubly valuable, particularly those who work in speaking the Word and in teaching.
46008007	Sin	But not everyone has this “knowledge.” Some who up to now have been so used to idols as a reality that when they eat food sacrificed to an idol, their conscience (which is weak) tells them they have defiled themselves.
