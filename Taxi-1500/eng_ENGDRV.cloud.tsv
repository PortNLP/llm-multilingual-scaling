53002011	Sin	That all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity.
45002024	Sin	(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)
55003008	Sin	Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.

46014001	Recommendation	Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.

56003003	Sin	For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

44013017	Grace	The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they were sojourners in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought them out from thence,
44015008	Grace	And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave testimony, giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as to us;
59002011	Sin	For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
43010028	Grace	And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.
45016020	Grace	And the God of peace crush Satan under your feet speedily. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

59002001	Faith	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.
45003013	Sin	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.

45009030	Faith	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who followed not after justice, have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.
54003009	Faith	Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.

51002004	Recommendation	Now this I say, that no man may deceive you by loftiness of words.
66005013	Description	And every creature, which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them: I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, benediction, and honour, and glory, and power, for ever and ever.

47004010	Faith	Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies.

60005004	Grace	And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.
47003012	Faith	Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence:
61002012	Sin	But these men, as irrational beasts, naturally tending to the snare and to destruction, blaspheming those things which they know not, shall perish in their corruption,

54003007	Recommendation	Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
49004007	Grace	But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the giving of Christ.
66016003	Description	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea, and there came blood as it were of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea.
49006006	Recommendation	Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men, but, as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart,

47001003	Grace	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.
54001006	Sin	From which things some going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling:
45001016	Faith	For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.
46003011	Description	For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus.
49005033	Recommendation	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband.

43011004	Faith	And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.
45001017	Faith	For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.
43019017	Description	And bearing his own cross, he went forth to that place which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha.
45012006	Faith	And having different gifts, according to the grace that is given us, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of faith;
66004007	Description	And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.
49005015	Recommendation	See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,

58010036	Recommendation	For patience is necessary for you; that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.
58011001	Faith	Now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.
49004017	Recommendation	This then I say and testify in the Lord: That henceforward you walk not as also the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,
51002016	Recommendation	Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths,

45002010	Grace	But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

58003001	Faith	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:
44020035	Recommendation	I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, how he said: It is a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive.
58013004	Recommendation	Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge.

43014021	Faith	He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
51002023	Sin	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh.
64001006	Recommendation	Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church: whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a manner worthy of God.
55002023	Recommendation	And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.
47003018	Faith	But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.
58009014	Grace	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?

66003003	Recommendation	Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard: and observe, and do penance. If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come to thee.

46011034	Recommendation	If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.
43018031	Description	Pilate therefore said to them: Take him you, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any man to death;
46012031	Faith	But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.
58007026	Description	For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

51004002	Recommendation	Be instant in prayer; watching in it with thanksgiving:

59004001	Sin	From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence, from your concupiscences, which war in your members?
46005001	Sin	It is absolutely heard, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens; that one should have his father’s wife.
46010013	Faith	Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.
44020029	Violence	I know that, after my departure, ravening wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
53001004	Faith	So that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith, and in all your persecutions and tribulations, which you endure,

43010019	Description	A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.
43003033	Faith	He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.
61003014	Recommendation	Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.
53003001	Faith	For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of God may run, and may be glorified, even as among you;

44015009	Faith	And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

46004016	Recommendation	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.
46001021	Faith	For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.
60003001	Recommendation	In like manner also let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives.
47005020	Recommendation	For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us. For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.

59002008	Recommendation	If then you fulfill the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.
47004005	Faith	For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord; and ourselves your servants through Jesus.
46015033	Recommendation	Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.
58013020	Grace	And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,
50001027	Recommendation	Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.
46006014	Grace	Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.
55001006	Recommendation	For which cause I admonish thee, that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee, by the imposition of my hands.

46007023	Recommendation	You are bought with a price; be not made the bondslaves of men.
46010010	Recommendation	Neither do you murmur: as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
47002017	Faith	For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.

66022015	Sin	Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and unchaste, and murderers, and servers of idols, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.
66002014	Sin	But I have against thee a few things: because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat, and to commit fornication:
53001003	Faith	We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you towards each other, aboundeth:
46012002	Sin	You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.
49005025	Recommendation	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:

60005006	Recommendation	Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:
44014017	Grace	And speaking these things, they scarce restrained the people from sacrificing to them.

55001009	Grace	Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world.
43019006	Violence	When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.
60001010	Grace	Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched, who prophesied of the grace to come in you.
63001007	Sin	For many seducers are gone out into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a seducer and an antichrist.
44024005	Sin	We have found this to be a pestilent man, and raising seditions among all the Jews throughout the world, and author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes.
54003016	Grace	And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world, is taken up in glory.
66016021	Violence	And great hail, like a talent, came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail: because it was exceeding great.

51003009	Recommendation	Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,

48003008	Grace	And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.
58012005	Recommendation	And you have forgotten the consolation, which speaketh to you, as unto children, saying: My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord; neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him.
58013017	Recommendation	Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.

63001010	Recommendation	If any man come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him, God speed you.
47001005	Grace	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound.
65001011	Sin	Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain: and after the error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves, and have perished in the contradiction of Core.

58009006	Description	Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.
44007051	Sin	You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you also.
54001009	Sin	Knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly, and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

66017012	Description	And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but shall receive power as kings one hour after the beast.

59005001	Recommendation	Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.
66002010	Recommendation	Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried: and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful until death: and I will give thee the crown of life.
54006011	Recommendation	But thou, O man of God, fly these things: and pursue justice, godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness.
59005005	Sin	You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.

54002012	Recommendation	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the man: but to be in silence.
46001009	Faith	God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
48005013	Recommendation	For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the spirit serve one another.
59002012	Recommendation	So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.
46012005	Faith	And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;
45009005	Description	Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.
47001006	Description	Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.
47001021	Faith	Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God:
44010015	Recommendation	And the voice spoke to him again the second time: That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call common.
66018009	Sin	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication, and lived in delicacies with her, shall weep, and bewail themselves over her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning:
43014023	Faith	Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him.
62004010	Grace	In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.
62001007	Faith	But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
48004007	Grace	Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.
58001008	Faith	But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
43010033	Sin	The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.
66014011	Description	And the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and ever: neither have they rest day nor night, who have adored the beast, and his image, and whoever receiveth the character of his name.
47004001	Faith	Therefore, seeing we have this ministration, according as we have obtained mercy, we faint not;
58013006	Faith	So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.
45014003	Recommendation	Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.

58007027	Description	Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, in offering himself.
62003017	Sin	He that hath the substance of this world, and shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him?
47005008	Faith	But we are confident, and have a good will to be absent rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
60002011	Recommendation	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,

50003002	Violence	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
56001016	Sin	They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate.
45010002	Faith	For I bear them witness, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
47001004	Grace	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God.
55002015	Recommendation	Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
53002004	Description	Who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God.
49006004	Recommendation	And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger; but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.
45008037	Grace	But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath loved us.
44026014	Violence	And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.
66002009	Sin	I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art rich: and thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
46013006	Faith	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth;
59001021	Recommendation	Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
46003006	Grace	I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.
66014008	Sin	And another angel followed, saying: That great Babylon is fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
43015014	Recommendation	You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you.
62005021	Recommendation	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
55003006	Sin	For of these sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:
49004015	Faith	But doing the truth in charity, we may in all things grow up in him who is the head, even Christ:
49004003	Faith	Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
44009005	Description	Who said: Who art thou, Lord? And he: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.

44007033	Recommendation	And the Lord said to him: Loose the shoes from thy feet, for the place wherein thou standest, is holy ground.
62002024	Faith	As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning, abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.
43008051	Faith	Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.
66020011	Description	And I saw a great white throne, and one sitting upon it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away, and there was no place found for them.
46006013	Recommendation	Meat for the belly, and the belly for the meats; but God shall destroy both it and them: but the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
45006011	Faith	So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
47002014	Faith	Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.
62001005	Grace	And this is the declaration which we have heard from him, and declare unto you: That God is light, and in him there is no darkness.

43019015	Violence	But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar.
45011005	Grace	Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.
66017002	Sin	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication; and they who inhabit the earth, have been made drunk with the whine of her whoredom.

54005017	Recommendation	Let the priests that rule well, be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine:
46008007	Sin	But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
43015002	Grace	Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
60005003	Recommendation	Neither as lording it over the clergy, but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart.
52004013	Recommendation	For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again; even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.
58011029	Description	By faith they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land: which the Egyptians attempting, were swallowed up.
44007020	Description	At the same time was Moses born, and he was acceptable to God: who was nourished three months in his father’s house.
58005002	Grace	Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
45013012	Recommendation	The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.
49006009	Recommendation	And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings, knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.
45012015	Recommendation	Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.
45002005	Sin	But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.
44014019	Violence	But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and entered into the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
43013021	Description	When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me.
48003022	Faith	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.
66011007	Violence	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast, that ascendeth out of the abyss, shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
58003014	Faith	For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.
45008010	Faith	And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the spirit liveth, because of justification.
44007052	Sin	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them who foretold of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:
48005021	Sin	Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.
