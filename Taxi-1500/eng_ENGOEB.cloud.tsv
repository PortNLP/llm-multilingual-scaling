55003008	Sin	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless.
66003019	Recommendation	All whom I love I rebuke and discipline. Therefore be in earnest and repent.
45005001	Faith	Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
54004016	Recommendation	Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.

61003009	Grace	The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.

47004006	Grace	Indeed, the same God who said ‘Out of darkness light will shine,’ has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.

56002015	Recommendation	Tell them of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone belittle you.
62004009	Grace	This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
43017024	Grace	Father, my desire for all those whom you have given me is that they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honor which you have given me; for thou did love me before the beginning of the world.

62003001	Grace	See what great love the Father has lavished on us: he lets us be called God's children! For that is what we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it has not learned to know him.

62005012	Faith	Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn't have God's Son does not have life.
43008036	Grace	If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!
49003013	Faith	Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor.

45001029	Sin	They reveled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarreling, treachery, malice.
55001014	Recommendation	Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.
48006008	Faith	For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.

51004005	Recommendation	Show tact in your behavior to the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.
45006006	Faith	We recognize the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
62003010	Sin	By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil's: anyone who doesn't do what is right or doesn't love others is not a child of God.
45008007	Sin	because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so.
44002026	Faith	Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight; Yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope;
46010020	Sin	No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons.
44013001	Description	Among the members of the church at Antioch there were several prophets and teachers — Barnabas, Simeon who was known by the name of ‘Black’, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, foster-brother of Prince Herod, and Saul.

43010001	Sin	In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber;
61002015	Sin	Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrong-doing,
44014005	Violence	and, when there was an attempt on the part of both Gentiles and Jews, with their leaders, to resort to violence and to stone them,

66021027	Sin	Never will any unhallowed thing enter it, nor they whose life is shameful and false, but only those whose names have been written in the Lamb's book of life.
66017004	Sin	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of idolatrous abominations, and the unclean fruits of her licentiousness;

43012023	Description	This was his reply — “The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted.

45007008	Sin	But sin took advantage of the Commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life.
44026017	Grace	since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,
56003003	Sin	There was a time when we ourselves were foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one another.
54005021	Recommendation	I charge you solemnly, before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to carry out these directions, unswayed by prejudice, never acting with partiality.
58010035	Recommendation	Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it.

43012026	Faith	If someone is ready to serve me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If a person is ready to serve me, my Father will honor them.

46007026	Recommendation	I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best — that a man should remain as he is.
43003001	Description	Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people.

44013017	Grace	The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, and during their stay in Egypt increased the prosperity of the people, and then with uplifted arm brought them out from that land.

59002011	Sin	He who said ‘You must not commit adultery’ also said ‘You must not murder.’ If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the Law.
43010028	Grace	and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands.
45016020	Grace	And God, the giver of peace, will before long crush Satan under your feet. May the blessing of Jesus, our Lord, be with you.
55003005	Sin	and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these.
45012005	Description	so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts.
56003008	Faith	This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all.
59002023	Faith	and that in this way the words of scripture came true — “Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,” and “He was called the friend of God.”
59002001	Faith	My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination?
45003013	Sin	‘Their throats are like opened graves; they deceive with their tongues.’ ‘The venom of snakes lies behind their lips,’
49005028	Recommendation	That is how husbands ought to love their wives — as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;
45009030	Faith	What are we to say, then? Why, that Gentiles, who were not in search of righteousness, secured it — a righteousness which was the result of faith;
54003009	Faith	but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience.
54006002	Recommendation	Those who have Christian masters should not think less of them because they are also followers of Christ, but on the contrary they should serve them all the better, because those who are to benefit by their good work are dear to them as their fellow Christians.
45003003	Faith	What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid!

58010039	Faith	But we do not belong to those who draw back, to their ruin, but to those who have faith, to the saving of their souls.
45011026	Grace	And then all Israel will be saved. As scripture says — ‘From Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.
52002015	Violence	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,
58010026	Sin	Remember, if we sin willfully after we have gained a full knowledge of the truth, there can be no further sacrifice for sin;
49002006	Grace	And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,
49004025	Recommendation	Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbors. For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.

45006012	Sin	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings.

49002001	Grace	You yourselves were once dead because of your offenses and sins.
46010021	Sin	You cannot drink both the Cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the Table of the Lord and at the table of demons.

45012018	Recommendation	If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone.
58010023	Faith	Let us maintain the confession of our hope unshaken, for he who has given us his promise will not fail us.
43014027	Grace	Peace be with you! My own peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, or dismayed.

43016002	Violence	They will expel you from their synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think that they are making an offering to God.
66015001	Description	Then I saw another portent in the heavens — a great and marvelous portent — seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them the wrath of God is ended.
43018023	Description	“If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,” replied Jesus; “but if not, why do you strike me?”
50004003	Recommendation	yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
66016006	Sin	for men shed the blood of Christ's people and of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve.’
45006002	Sin	Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, and how can we go on living in it?
66017011	Violence	So must the Beast that was, but is not. He counts as an eighth king, although he is one of the seven, and is on his way to destruction.
48004030	Recommendation	But what does the passage of scripture say? ‘Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slave's son will not be coheir with the son of the free woman.’
54006009	Sin	Those who want to be rich fall into the net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin.
66017016	Violence	The ten horns that you saw, and the Beast — they will hate the Harlot, and cause her to become deserted and strip her bare; they will eat her flesh and utterly consume her with fire.
46008003	Faith	On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.
45003009	Sin	What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin.
44007041	Sin	That was the time when they made the calf and offered sacrifice to their idol, and held festivities in honor of their own handiwork!
66009020	Sin	But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had made; they would not abandon the worship of demons, and of idols made of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;
47005011	Faith	Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.
49002003	Sin	And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.
44002040	Recommendation	Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them — “Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.”
45008013	Faith	If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live.
45010011	Faith	As the passage of scripture says — ‘No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.’
45001008	Faith	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.
52001004	Faith	Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,
60004008	Recommendation	Above all things, let your love for one another be earnest, for ‘Love throws a veil over countless sins.’
44027001	Description	As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a captain of the Augustan Guard, named Julius.
66015003	Faith	They are singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb — ‘Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord, our God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, eternal King.
60002002	Faith	like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation —
66014013	Faith	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying ‘Write: “Blessed are the dead who from this hour die in union with the Lord.” ’ “Yes,” answers the Spirit, “that they may rest from their toil. Their good deeds go with them.”
59001027	Faith	That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this — to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.
51002004	Recommendation	I say this to prevent anyone from deceiving you by plausible arguments.
66005013	Description	And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying — ‘To him who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed all blessing, and honor, and praise, and dominion for ever and ever.’
66008008	Description	Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,
44007058	Violence	and began to stone him, the witnesses laying their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
45015011	Faith	And yet again — ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.’
45011036	Faith	For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.
43001029	Faith	The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
58011031	Description	Faith saved Rahab, the prostitute, from perishing with the unbelievers, after she had entertained the spies with friendliness.
43010010	Grace	The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness.
50003020	Faith	But we are citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a savior to come, the Lord Jesus Christ.
45015007	Recommendation	Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God.
44021024	Recommendation	Join these men, share their purification, and bear their expenses, so that they may shave their heads; and then all will see that there is no truth in what they have been told about you, but that, on the contrary, you yourself rule your life in obedience to the Jewish Law.
45004012	Faith	as well as father of the circumcised — to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised.
44001026	Description	Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen to Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven apostles.
45004007	Grace	‘Blessed are those whose wrong-doings have been forgiven and over whose sins a veil has been drawn!
66011004	Description	These men are represented by the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth.
59004009	Recommendation	Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom!
64001011	Recommendation	Dear friend, do not follow a bad example, but a good one. The person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is bad has never seen God.
45004011	Faith	Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision — to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man — in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;
45006007	Grace	For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin.
47004010	Faith	We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.
50002021	Sin	They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.
58011011	Faith	Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was past the age for child-bearing), because she felt sure that he who had given her the promise would not fail her.
43006039	Grace	and his will is this — that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the Last day.
46008006	Faith	Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).
52003006	Description	But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us — always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you —
60005004	Grace	Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.
47003012	Faith	With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;
61002012	Sin	These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature to be caught and killed — these people, I say, malign those of whom they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own corruption,
43012006	Sin	He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.
62004016	Faith	And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us. God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them.
44011019	Description	Now those who had been scattered in different directions, in consequence of the persecution that followed the death of Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, telling the message — but only to Jews.
54006006	Faith	Of course religion is a great source of gain — when combined with contentment!
66013007	Violence	It had been permitted to fight with Christ's people and to conquer them, and it had received power over men of every tribe, and people, and language, and nation.
60002020	Faith	What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.
58009015	Grace	And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.
45006001	Sin	What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God's loving kindness may be multiplied?
49005004	Recommendation	nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.
66006008	Violence	And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider's name was Death, and Hades rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild Beasts of the earth.
45004016	Faith	That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God's gift, and in order that the fulfillment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham's descendants — not only for those who take their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the Father of us all;
44028018	Description	The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death.
45009016	Grace	So, then, all depends, not on human wishes or human efforts, but on God's mercy.
46010008	Sin	Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.
45007023	Sin	but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavors to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.
58006001	Faith	Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God —
46016011	Recommendation	No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends.
59002014	Faith	My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them?
43007025	Description	At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death?
43020022	Faith	After saying this, he breathed on them, and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit;
45010003	Sin	for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.
62005010	Faith	The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son.
43014012	Faith	In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me will themselves do the work that I am doing; and they will do greater work still, because I am going to the Father.
56002009	Recommendation	Tell slaves to respect their owner's authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.
58012015	Recommendation	Take care that no one fails to use the loving help of God, ‘that no bitterness is allowed to take root and spring up, and cause trouble,’ and so poison the whole community.
54003007	Recommendation	They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil's trap.
49004007	Grace	Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.
66016003	Description	Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died — everything in the sea.
49006006	Recommendation	not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had merely to please people, but as slaves of Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God.
60003016	Recommendation	and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame.
43006040	Faith	For it is the will of my Father that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have immortal life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last day.”
44012023	Violence	Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was attacked with worms, and died.
47001003	Grace	Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,
54001006	Sin	And it is because they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people has been diverted to unprofitable subjects.
45001016	Faith	For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.
46003011	Description	for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid — Jesus Christ.
49005033	Recommendation	However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband.
51002013	Grace	And to you, who once were dead, by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature — to you God gave life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins!
54004014	Recommendation	Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were laid on your head.
66021001	Description	Then I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away; and the sea has ceased to be.
52005016	Recommendation	Always be joyful;
66009006	Description	In those days people will seek Death and will not find it; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.
52004014	Faith	For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest.
62004015	Faith	Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God.
49004022	Recommendation	For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;
43010009	Grace	I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture.
58011037	Violence	They were stoned to death, they were tortured, they were swan asunder, they were put to the sword; they wandered about clothed in the skins of sheep or goats, destitute, persecuted, ill-used —
62002029	Faith	Since you know he is righteous, you realize that that everyone who does what is right is his child.
44013047	Grace	For this is the Lord's command to us — ‘I have destined you for a light to the Gentiles, a means of salvation to the ends of the earth’.”
47004002	Faith	No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God's message, and commending ourselves to everyone's conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.
44002033	Description	And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear.
51003010	Recommendation	and clothe yourselves with that new self, which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed in resemblance to him who made it.
43011004	Faith	and, when Jesus heard it, he said, “This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honor of God, in order that the Son of God may be honored through it.”
45001017	Faith	For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says — ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’
43019017	Description	and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.
45012006	Faith	Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith;
66004007	Description	The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature has a face like a man's, and the fourth creature is like an eagle on the wing.
49005015	Recommendation	Take great care, then, how you live — not unwisely but wisely,
45010012	Grace	For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.
45010004	Faith	For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.
50004006	Recommendation	Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God.

52004006	Recommendation	none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.
47005017	Faith	Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun!
43005020	Faith	For the Father loves his Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him still greater things — so that you will be filled with wonder.
49004028	Recommendation	Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.
57001022	Recommendation	Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers.
58013009	Recommendation	Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are guided by such regulations have not found them of service.
52005012	Recommendation	We beg you, friends, to value those who toil among you, and are your leaders in the Lord's service, and give you counsel.
43009022	Description	His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues.

59005013	Recommendation	If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is happy, they should sing hymns.
58012012	Recommendation	Therefore ‘lift again the down-dropped hands and straighten the weakened knees;
60001017	Recommendation	And since you call on him as ‘Father,’ who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth.
58010036	Recommendation	You still have need of patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God's will, you may obtain the fulfillment of his promise.
58011001	Faith	Faith is the realization of things hoped for — the proof of things not seen.

51002016	Recommendation	Do not, then, allow anyone to take you to task on questions of eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly festivals.
66007015	Faith	And therefore it is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter them.
44020010	Description	But Paul went down, threw himself on him, and put his arms around him. “Do not be alarmed,” he said, “he is still alive.”
55002010	Faith	and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God's people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory.
60005014	Recommendation	Greet one another with the kiss of love. May God give his peace to you all in your union with Christ.
49005021	Recommendation	Submit to one another because you honor and respect Christ.
61003017	Recommendation	You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness;
51003018	Recommendation	Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the Lord.
54005020	Recommendation	but rebuke offenders publicly, so that others may take warning.
45014013	Recommendation	Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve — never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord.
45002010	Grace	But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does right — for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,

48006017	Faith	For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.
66018021	Violence	Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, crying — “So will Babylon, the great city, be violently overthrown, never more to be seen.
65001020	Faith	But you must, dear friends, build up your characters on the foundation of your most holy faith, pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
45012002	Recommendation	Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God's will is — all that is good, acceptable, and perfect.
46015009	Sin	For I am the meanest of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of ‘apostle,’ because I persecuted the church of God.
62002015	Recommendation	Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them.
45002001	Sin	Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defense, whoever you are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same things.
48002009	Description	Recognizing the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.
43019023	Description	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares — a share for each soldier — and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.
45002021	Sin	Why, then, you teacher of others, don't you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and yet steal?
46006019	Faith	Again, don't you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?
47005014	Grace	It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;
58003001	Faith	Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.
44020035	Recommendation	I left nothing undone to show you that, laboring as I labored, you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said himself — ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”
58013004	Recommendation	Let marriage be honored by all and the married life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery.

66019010	Faith	I prostrated myself at the feet of him who spoke to worship him, but he said to me — ‘No! I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus needs the inspiration of the prophets.’
46002010	Grace	Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God's being.
50002029	Recommendation	Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honor.
51003020	Recommendation	Children, always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who belong to the Lord.
47001012	Faith	Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this — Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.
43014021	Faith	It is they who have my commands and lays them to heart who loves me; and the person who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them, and will reveal myself to them.”
51002023	Sin	Such prohibitions appear reasonable where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called ‘humility,’ and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value against the indulgence of our earthly nature.
64001006	Recommendation	They themselves have testified before the church to your love. You will do well to help them on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God.
55002023	Recommendation	Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels;
47003018	Faith	And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.
58009014	Grace	how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!
44011017	Grace	Since then, God had given them the very same gift as he gave us when we became believers in Jesus Christ the Master — who was I that I could thwart God?”
49004030	Faith	And do not grieve God's Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of redemption.
66003003	Recommendation	Therefore remember what you have received and heard, and lay it to heart and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I am coming to you.
62003007	Recommendation	My children, don't let anyone mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.
62004001	Recommendation	Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
44013038	Grace	I would, therefore, like you to know, friends, that through Jesus forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you,
50003001	Recommendation	In conclusion, my friends, all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.
46011034	Recommendation	If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I come.
43018031	Description	“Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own Law.” “We have no power to put anyone to death,” the authorities replied —

58007026	Description	This was the high priest that we needed — holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven,
50004013	Faith	I can do everything in the strength of him who makes me strong!
52004003	Recommendation	For this is God's purpose — that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality;
51004002	Recommendation	Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also offer thanksgiving;
44007029	Description	At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him.
46011007	Description	A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man's glory.
51003015	Faith	Let the peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show yourselves thankful.
58002010	Grace	It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.
59004001	Sin	What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Isn't it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?
46005001	Sin	There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles — a man, I hear, is living with his father's wife!
46010013	Faith	No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.
44020029	Violence	I know that, after my departure, merciless wolves will get in among you, who will not spare the flock;
53001004	Faith	So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring.
62004012	Faith	No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us.
48001001	Description	To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;
58012003	Recommendation	Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such opposition from ‘people who were sinning against themselves,’ so that you should not grow weary or faint-hearted.
45006005	Faith	If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection.
45015010	Recommendation	And again it says — ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God's people.’
54004001	Sin	But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,
56003001	Recommendation	Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one, to avoid quarreling,
61003005	Sin	For they willfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also — formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;
60003018	Grace	For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all — the good on behalf of the bad — that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life.
61002021	Sin	It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them.
53003006	Recommendation	We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.
45005012	Sin	Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.
58011033	Faith	By their faith they subdued kingdoms, ruled righteously, gained the fulfillment of God's promises, shut the mouths of lions,
47004009	Faith	though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed!
59004004	Sin	Unfaithful people! Don't you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.
44016006	Description	They next went through the Phrygian district of Galatia, but were restrained by the Holy Spirit from delivering the message in Roman Asia.

66016002	Violence	The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the Beast and who worshiped its image.
66005008	Description	And, when he had taken the book, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ's people.)
62005001	Faith	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child.
48005026	Recommendation	Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another.
54005001	Recommendation	Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers,
60002012	Recommendation	Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evil-doers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God ‘at the time when he will visit them.’
50003006	Sin	as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself blameless.
43004052	Description	So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o'clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.”
43019031	Violence	It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.
43019012	Description	This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!”
43014001	Faith	Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.
50001028	Faith	without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation — a sign from God.
43015016	Grace	It wasn't you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit — fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my name.
58011004	Faith	Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain's, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.
46004001	Recommendation	Let people look on us as Christ's servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.
66006013	Description	The stars of the heavens fell to the earth, as when a fig-tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.

45012021	Recommendation	Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
55002014	Recommendation	Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it.
59004008	Recommendation	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators!
59002009	Sin	but, if you discriminate, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it.
52004007	Grace	For God's call to us does not permit of an impure life, but demands purity.
45001018	Sin	So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.
62004007	Faith	Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.
62002009	Sin	The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness.
60004014	Grace	If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you.
44021019	Grace	After greeting them, Paul related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his efforts;
43008046	Sin	Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don't you believe me, if I am speaking truth?
58010017	Grace	then we have — ‘And their sins and their iniquities I will no longer remember.’
46001005	Grace	For through union with him you were enriched in every way — in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;

43007020	Violence	“You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?”
45003025	Grace	For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed;
43018018	Description	The servants and police officers were standing around a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.
49006011	Recommendation	Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the devil.
43013037	Faith	“Why cannot I follow you now, Master?” asked Peter. “I will lay down my life for you.”
50004007	Faith	Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.
59003009	Faith	With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God's likeness.’
46005010	Sin	not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.
44026009	Sin	I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of Jesus of Nazareth;
61002014	Sin	They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse.
43010012	Description	The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock.
59001019	Recommendation	Mark this, my dear friends — Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry;
46009014	Recommendation	So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should get their living from the good news.
43012046	Grace	I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in me should remain in the darkness.
43005014	Description	Afterward Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him, “You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.”
46016014	Recommendation	Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit.
43014015	Recommendation	If you love me, you will lay my commands to heart,
58012025	Recommendation	Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.
48004008	Sin	Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to ‘gods’ which were no gods.
44003026	Grace	For you, first, God raised up his servant, and sent him to bless you, by turning each one of you from his wicked ways.”
44010039	Violence	We are ourselves, too, witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him to death by hanging him on a cross!
46001010	Recommendation	But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united — of one mind and of one opinion.
51001021	Sin	And it pleased God that you, once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent only on wickedness —
55002022	Recommendation	Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord.
51003001	Faith	Since, therefore, you were raised to life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above; for it is there that the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
66008007	Violence	The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.
66011017	Faith	saying — ‘We thank you, Lord, our God, the Almighty, who is and who was, that you have assumed your great power and reigned.
43004010	Grace	“If you knew of the gift of God,” replied Jesus, “and who it is that is saying to you ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
51003004	Grace	When the Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
43020031	Faith	but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God — and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life.
62004006	Faith	We come from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.
65001012	Description	These are the people who are blots on your ‘love-feasts,’ when they feast together and provide without scruple for themselves alone. They are clouds without rain, driven before the winds; they are leafless trees without a vestige of fruit, dead through and through, torn up by the roots;
44005015	Description	The consequence was that people would bring out their sick even into the streets, and lay them on mattresses and mats, in the hope that, as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on someone of them.
49006016	Faith	At every onslaught take up faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one.
51003023	Recommendation	Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if working for the Master and not for people,
58012016	Recommendation	Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
43018040	Sin	“No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber.
55003004	Sin	treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God;
50002009	Grace	And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names,
61001016	Description	For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.
61003016	Sin	It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own ruin.
44014014	Description	But, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd. “Friends, why are you doing this?” they shouted.
45015008	Faith	For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God's truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfill the promises made to our ancestors,
59001026	Sin	When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person's religious observances are valueless.
43015020	Recommendation	Remember what I said to you — ‘A servant is not greater than their master.’ If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also.
43008031	Faith	So Jesus went on to say to those who had believed him, “If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples;
44007011	Description	Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food.
63001004	Faith	It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father.
54005008	Faith	Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
58010022	Faith	let us draw near to God in all sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies washed with pure water.
48001023	Description	all that they had heard was — ‘The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc.’
44027034	Recommendation	So I beg you to take something to eat; your safety depends on it, for not one of you will lose even a hair of his head.”
66002003	Faith	You possess endurance, and have borne much for my name, and have never grown weary.

66019013	Description	he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and the name by which he is called is ‘The Word of God.’
46008009	Recommendation	But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.
44013034	Grace	As to his raising Jesus from the dead, never again to return to corruption, this is what is said — ‘I will give to you the sacred promises made to David;’
43014020	Faith	At that time you will recognize that I am in union with the Father, and you with me, and I with you.
62002003	Faith	It is by keeping God's commands that we can be sure we know him.
43008024	Sin	and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.”
66017006	Sin	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of Christ's people and with the blood of the martyrs for Jesus. When I saw her, I was amazed beyond measure;

43007012	Description	and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others, ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’
44011021	Faith	The power of the Lord was with them, so that a great number who had learned to believe came over to the Lord's side.
52002004	Faith	But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.
46015057	Grace	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
54005005	Faith	As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.

46007021	Recommendation	Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.
65001019	Sin	These are the people — animal and unspiritual — who cause divisions.
48001006	Sin	I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different ‘good news,’
58012014	Recommendation	Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that purity without which no one will see the Lord.
43021006	Description	“Cast your net to the right of the boat,” he said, “and you will find fish.” So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.

44019002	Faith	“Did you, when you became believers in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?” “No,” they answered, “we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit.”
53003014	Recommendation	If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed.
46015050	Sin	This I say, friends — Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.
43006027	Recommendation	Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father — God himself — has set the seal of his approval.”

49005020	Faith	Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
48003006	Faith	It is just as it was with Abraham — he had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.

45008009	Faith	You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ;
45011023	Faith	And they, too, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has it in his power to graft them in again.
66014005	Description	No lie was ever heard on their lips. They are beyond reach of blame.
44024014	Faith	This, however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the Way which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the prophets;

48001013	Sin	You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism — how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and made havoc of it,
66020002	Description	He seized the Dragon, the primeval snake (who is the ‘devil’ or ‘Satan’), and bound him in chains for a thousand years.

44022004	Violence	In my persecution of this Way I did not stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men and women alike —
43007043	Description	So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.
60005002	Recommendation	I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;
46015056	Sin	It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the Law that gives sin its power.
59005004	Sin	Listen! The wages you have held back from the laborers who mowed your fields are crying out against you, and the outcries of your harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts!
60002001	Recommendation	Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting,
46007039	Recommendation	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer.
55002018	Sin	They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people's faith.
48005006	Faith	If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.
58005009	Grace	and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation,
46016001	Recommendation	With reference to the collection for Christ's people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia.
49005022	Recommendation	Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.
43008012	Faith	Jesus again addressed the people. “I am the light of the world,” he said. “The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”
65001017	Recommendation	But you should, dear friends, recall what was foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
44017025	Grace	neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.
62005009	Faith	We accept human testimony, surely God's testimony is even stronger! And God's testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son.
45013014	Faith	No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.
58011030	Description	Faith caused the walls of Jericho to fall after being encircled for seven days.
44019011	Grace	God did miracles of no ordinary kind by Paul's hands;
43008034	Sin	“In truth I tell you,” replied Jesus, “everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
62004011	Faith	Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another.
44002028	Grace	You have shown me the path to life, You will fill me with gladness in your presence.’
54004013	Recommendation	Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.
47004008	Description	Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;
44002013	Description	But there were some who said with a sneer, “They have had too much new wine.”
66021018	Description	The material of the wall of the city was jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear glass.
66015006	Description	and out of it came the seven angels with the seven curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles around their breasts.
45012014	Recommendation	Bless your persecutors — bless and never curse.
66001015	Description	and his feet were like brass as when molten in a furnace; his voice was like the sound of many streams,
43017026	Grace	I have made you known to them, and will do so still; that the love that you have had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.”
45008032	Grace	God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things?
65001018	Sin	how they used to say to you — ‘As time draws to an end, there will be scoffers, who will be led by their godless passions.’
45011018	Recommendation	Yet do not exult over the other branches. But, if you do exult over them, remember that you do not support the root, but that the root supports you.
47001024	Faith	I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.
43011001	Description	Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha.
52004008	Sin	Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
62004002	Faith	This is the way to recognize the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God's Spirit,
65001008	Sin	Yet in the same way these people, too, cherishing vain dreams, pollute our human nature, reject control, and malign the celestial beings.
60003011	Recommendation	they should turn from evil and do good, They should seek for peace and follow after it;
51001023	Faith	if only you remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made an assistant.

49004024	Recommendation	and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.
66014012	Faith	(Here there is need for endurance on the part of Christ's people — those who lay to heart the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.)
44013030	Description	But God raised him from the dead;
43010011	Description	I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.
49003002	Grace	For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,
56003010	Recommendation	If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a second warning, excuse yourself from them.
43010019	Description	In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people.
43003033	Faith	They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true.
61003014	Recommendation	Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace.
53003001	Faith	In conclusion, friends, pray for us — pray that the Lord's message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honor, as it was among you;
47004014	Faith	For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.
59005014	Recommendation	If anyone of you is ill, they should send for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.
44007023	Description	When he was in his fortieth year, he resolved to visit his fellow Israelites;
44023027	Violence	The man whom I send with this had been seized by some Jews, and was on the point of being killed by them, when I came upon them with the force under my command, and rescued him, as I learned that he was a Roman citizen.
44019029	Description	The commotion spread through the whole city, and the people rushed together into the amphitheater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were Paul's traveling companions.

44015009	Faith	He made no distinction between them and us, when he purified their hearts by their faith.
46011028	Recommendation	Let everyone look into their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
46015058	Faith	Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord's work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain.
46004016	Recommendation	Therefore I entreat you — Follow my example.
46001021	Faith	For since the world, in God's wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the ‘folly’ of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ!
60003001	Recommendation	Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives,
47005020	Recommendation	It is, then, on Christ's behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf — Be reconciled to God.
44002024	Description	But God released him from the pangs of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain its hold on him.
59002007	Sin	Isn't it they who malign that honorable name spoken over you at your baptism?
54003003	Description	not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;
43004014	Grace	but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him — a source of eternal life.”
62002005	Faith	But the person who keeps God's word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him:
66016013	Description	And I saw three foul spirits, like frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.
59002008	Recommendation	If you keep the royal law which runs — ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself,’ you are doing right;
47004005	Faith	(For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.)
46015033	Recommendation	Do not be deceived. ‘Good character is marred by evil company.’
58013020	Grace	May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead him who, ‘by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable covenant, is the great shepherd of God's Sheep,’ Jesus, our Lord —
50001027	Recommendation	Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,
46006014	Grace	and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power.
55001006	Recommendation	And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands.
60004006	Grace	For that was why the good news was told to the dead also — that, after they have been judged in the body, as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives.
46007023	Recommendation	You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.
46010010	Recommendation	And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death.
47002017	Faith	Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God's message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God's commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.
45015001	Recommendation	We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves.
50002024	Faith	And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow.
66007001	Description	After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.
60004003	Sin	Surely in the past you have spent time enough living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-drinking, and profane idolatry.
66011005	Violence	When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this way, inevitably perish.
44023005	Recommendation	“I did not know, brothers, that it was the high priest,” said Paul, “for scripture says — ‘Of the ruler of your people you should speak no ill’.”
66022015	Sin	Outside will be the filthy, the sorcerers, the impure, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who love the false and live it.
66002014	Sin	Yet I have a few things against you — You have among you those who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put temptations in the way of the Israelites, so that they should eat idol-offerings and commit licentious acts.
53001003	Faith	Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because, without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing.
46012002	Sin	You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led.
49005025	Recommendation	Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,
45012017	Recommendation	Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognize as honorable.
60005006	Recommendation	Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,
44014017	Grace	Yet he has not failed to give you, in the good he does, some revelation of himself — sending you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, and gladdening your hearts with plenty and good cheer.”
54003011	Recommendation	It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.
66002021	Sin	I gave her time to repent, but she is determined not to turn from her licentiousness.
44012020	Description	It happened that Herod was deeply offended with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they went in a body to him, and, having succeeded in winning over Blastus, the Chamberlain, they begged Herod for a reconciliation, because their country was dependent on the king's for its food supply.
43008049	Sin	“I am not possessed by a demon,” Jesus answered, “but I am honoring my Father; and yet you dishonor me.
43006018	Description	the sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing.
45008018	Faith	I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us.
62002012	Grace	Little children, I am writing to you because your sins have been forgiven for Christ's sake.
55001009	Grace	It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn call — not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfillment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began,
43019006	Violence	When the chief priests and the police officers saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” “Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate. “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.”
60001010	Grace	It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend;
63001007	Sin	I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world — men who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person is a deceiver and antichrist.
44024005	Sin	We have found this man a public pest; he is one who stirs up disputes among our people all the world over, and is a ringleader of the Nazarene heretics.
54003016	Grace	Yes, and confessedly wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for — ‘He was revealed in our nature, Pronounced righteous in spirit, Seen by angels, Proclaimed among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Taken up into glory.’
66016021	Violence	Great hailstones, a pound in weight, are falling on men from the heavens. And men blasphemed God because of the curse of the hail, for it was a very terrible curse.
61003013	Faith	but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will have its home, in fulfillment of the promise of God.
66006014	Description	The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
58010010	Grace	And it is in the fulfillment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.
52001002	Faith	We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;
66006004	Violence	Then there went out another horse, a red horse, and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.
54006001	Recommendation	All who are in the position of slaves should regard their masters as deserving of the greatest respect, so that the name of God, and our teaching, may not be maligned.
51003009	Recommendation	Never lie to one another. Get rid of your old self and its habits,
66002020	Sin	Yet I have this against you — You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who declares that she is a prophet, and misleads my servants by her teaching, until they commit licentious acts and eat idol-offerings.
48003008	Grace	And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words — ‘Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed.’
58012005	Recommendation	and you have forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as God's children — ‘My child, think not lightly of the Lord's discipline, Do not despond when he rebukes you;
58013017	Recommendation	Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would not be to your advantage.
44013019	Description	then, after destroying seven heathen nations in Canaan, he allotted their land to this people —
54006003	Faith	Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound instruction — the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ — and to the teaching of religion,
63001010	Recommendation	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or even welcome them;
47001005	Grace	It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.
65001011	Sin	Alas for them! They walk in the steps of Cain; led astray by Balaam's love of gain, they plunge into sin, and meet their ruin through rebellion like Korah.
65001010	Sin	But these people malign whatever they do not understand; while they use such things as they know by instinct (like the animals that have no reason) for their own corruption.
58011007	Faith	It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on faith.
58009006	Description	Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;
44007051	Sin	Stubborn people, heathen in heart and ears, you are for ever resisting the Holy Spirit; your ancestors did it, and you are doing it still.
54001009	Sin	by one who recognizes that laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly, for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
46005009	Recommendation	I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people —
48001015	Grace	But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,
45007015	Description	I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate.
61003018	Faith	and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.
46004010	Description	We, for Christ's sake, are fools, but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are despised.
60005009	Faith	Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord's followers throughout the world.
51003022	Recommendation	Slaves, always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to please people alone, but giving them ungrudging service, in your respect for the Master.
66017012	Description	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received their kingdoms, but for an hour they receive the authority of kings, together with the Beast.
46002012	Grace	And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.
59005001	Recommendation	Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!
66002010	Recommendation	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tempted, and may undergo persecution for ten days. Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the Crown of life.
54006011	Recommendation	But you must, servant of God, avoid all this. Aim at righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.
59005005	Sin	You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed.
66004004	Description	And around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold.
66018007	Description	for her self-glorification and her luxury, give her now an equal measure of torture and misery. In her heart she says ‘I sit here a queen; no widow am I; I will never know misery.’
60003007	Recommendation	Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance.
54002012	Recommendation	I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss.
46001009	Faith	God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
48005013	Recommendation	Remember, friends, to you the call came to give you freedom. Only do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence, but serve one another in a loving spirit.
59002012	Recommendation	Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the ‘Law of freedom.’
46012005	Faith	ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same;
45009005	Description	They are descended from the Patriarchs; and, as far as his human nature was concerned, from them came the Christ — he who is supreme over all things, God for ever blessed. Amen.
47001006	Description	If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;
47001021	Faith	God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,
44010015	Recommendation	Again he was aware of a voice which said — “What God has pronounced clean, do not regard as defiled.”
66018009	Sin	All the kings of the earth who had licentious intercourse with her and shared her luxury will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke from the burning city,
43014023	Faith	“Whoever loves me,” Jesus answered, “will lay my message to heart; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.
62004010	Grace	This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
62001007	Faith	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
48004007	Grace	You, therefore, are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by God's appointment.
58001008	Faith	while of the Son he said — ‘God is your throne for ever and ever; The scepter of his kingdom is the scepter of Justice;
43010033	Sin	“It is not for any good action that we would stone you,” they answered, “but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.”
66014011	Description	The smoke from their torture rises for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night — those who worship the Beast and its image, and all who are branded with its name.’
47004001	Faith	Therefore, since it is by God's mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.
58013006	Faith	Therefore we may say with confidence — ‘The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid. What can mere people do to me?’
45014003	Recommendation	The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them.
45015005	Grace	And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ,
58007027	Description	one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice.
62003017	Sin	If anyone has material possessions, and and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within them?
47005008	Faith	And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.
60002011	Recommendation	Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul.
60002017	Recommendation	Show honor to everyone, love the Lord's followers, ‘revere God, honor the emperor.’
44007025	Description	He thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so.
50003002	Violence	Beware of those dogs! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves!
56001016	Sin	They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work.
45010002	Faith	I can testify that they are zealous for the honor of God; but they are not guided by true insight,
47001004	Grace	who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.
55002015	Recommendation	Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth.
53002004	Description	who so opposes himself to everyone that is spoken of as a God or as an object of worship, and so exalts himself above them, that he seats himself in the Temple of God, and displays himself as God!
49006004	Recommendation	And fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up with Christian discipline and instruction.

66011007	Violence	As soon as they have completed their testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer and kill them.
58003014	Faith	For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.

51002005	Faith	It is true that I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ.

59002017	Faith	In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing.
45008003	Sin	What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature,

43014010	Faith	Don't you believe that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me? In giving you my teaching I am not speaking on my own authority; but the Father himself, always in union with me, does his own work.
44016022	Violence	The mob rose as one person against them, and the Magistrates stripped them of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
