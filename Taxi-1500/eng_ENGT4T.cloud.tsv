62003016	Faith	The way that we now know how to truly love our fellow believers is by remembering that Christ ◄voluntarily died/gave his life► for us. So, when our fellow believers need something, we should be willing to help them. We should even be willing to die for them.
43013001	Grace	When it was the evening before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that it was time for him to leave this world and to return to his Father in heaven. He loved us who were his disciples. He knew we would continue to live here in this world, so now he showed us how completely he loved us.
58003017	Sin	And ◄ you must remember who it was that God was disgusted with for forty years./do you remember who it was that God was disgusted with for forty years?► [RHQ] ◄It was those same people who had sinned like that, and whose bodies as a result lay where they died in the desert!/Was it not those same people who had sinned like that, and whose bodies as a result lay where they died in the desert area?► [RHQ]
60001014	Recommendation	And because you should obey your heavenly Father [SIM], as children ought to obey their fathers here on earth, do not do the evil deeds that you used to desire to do when you did not know God's truth.
45011032	Grace	God has declared and proved that all people, both Jews and non-Jews [MET], disobey ◄ him/his laws►. He has declared that because he wants to act mercifully towards us all.
66006006	Description	I heard a voice that sounded like it was coming from among the four living creatures. It was saying ◄ to the horseman/to the man who was sitting on the horse►, “A quart of wheat will cost so much that a man must work a whole day to earn enough money to buy it, and three quarts of barley will sell for the same price. But do not cut off the supply of olive oil or the wine [MTY]!”
59004010	Recommendation	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and as a result he will honor you.
44017031	Grace	He tells us that on a certain day that he has chosen he is going to judge all of us(inc) people in [MTY] the world. He has appointed a certain man to judge us, and that man will judge each of us fairly/justly. God has shown to all people that he has appointed that man to judge everyone, because God ◄caused him to become alive again after he had died/raised him from the dead►.”
43019002	Description	The soldiers also took some branches with thorns and wove them to make something like a crown. Then they put it on his head. They also put a purple robe on him. They did these things to ridicule him by pretending that he was a king.
54005014	Recommendation	So I advise that instead of putting the names of younger widows on the list, they marry again, that they bear/have children, that they manage their homes well, and that they do nothing about which an enemy can say bad things about them.
43014011	Faith	Believe that I have a close relationship with my Father and that my Father has a close relationship with me. If you do not believe that just because of what I say, believe it because of the miracles themselves that I have done.
66020014	Violence	All the unbelievers [PRS, MTY] —those who had been in the place where they waited after they died— were thrown into the burning lake. The burning lake is the place in which people die the second time.
58009026	Description	If that were so, he would have needed to suffer and shed his blood repeatedly since the time when God created the world. But instead, in this final age, Christ has appeared once in order that by sacrificing himself he could cause that people no longer will be punished for their sins.
44013018	Description	Even though they repeatedly disobeyed him, he cared for them for about forty years while they were in the desert.
46011033	Recommendation	So, my fellow believers, when you gather together to eat food to remember the Lord's dying for you, wait until everyone has arrived so that you can find out who does not have enough food.
66006012	Violence	I saw that when the one who is like a lamb opened the sixth seal, the earth shook violently. The sun became as black as cloth made ◄of black wool/of pitch►. The whole moon became red [SIM] like blood.
58011035	Violence	Some women who trusted God received their relatives back again when God ◄ made them live again after they had died/raised them from the dead►. But others who trusted God were tortured until they died. They were tortured because they refused to agree when their captors said, “We will release you if you deny that you believe in God.” They refused to do that, because they wanted to live with God forever, which is better than continuing to live on earth after having almost died.
44016037	Violence	But Paul said to the police officers, “The authorities commanded men to beat us in front of a crowd before those authorities had learned if we (exc) had done anything wrong! Then they ordered men to shove us into jail! But that was not legal, because we (exc) are Roman citizens! And now they want [RHQ] to send us away secretly! We will not accept that! Those Roman officials must come themselves and tell us that they are sorry, and take us out of jail.”
45013009	Recommendation	There are many things that God commanded in his laws, such as do not commit adultery, do not murder anyone, do not steal, and do not desire anything that belongs to someone else. But the command by which they are all summed up {that includes them all} is this: Each of you must love the people with whom you come in contact, just like you (sg) love yourself.
62003003	Faith	So, all those who confidently expect to see Christ as he actually is/what Christ is like when he returns must keep themselves pure in every way, just like Christ, who is pure in every way.
45007022	Faith	With my new inner nature I like the laws of God very much.
50004004	Recommendation	Because you have a relationship with the Lord, always rejoice! I say again, rejoice!
66001012	Description	In this vision I turned in order that I might see who had spoken to me [SYN]. When I turned,
58003018	Sin	And ◄ you must remember about whom God solemnly declared, “They will not enter the land where I would let them rest.”/do you remember about whom God solemnly declared, “They will not enter the land where I would let them rest”?► [RHQ] It was those Israelites who disobeyed God.
43010008	Sin	All of your religious leaders who have come previously without my authority are like [MET] thieves and bandits because they act violently and dishonestly for their own benefit. But just like sheep do not obey strangers, God's people do not pay attention to them.
60002018	Recommendation	You slaves who are believers, submit yourselves to your masters and completely respect them. Submit yourselves not only to those who act in a good and kind [DOU] way towards you, but also submit yourselves to those who act in a harsh way towards you.
44006013	Description	They also brought in some other men who accused Stephen falsely about several things. They said, “This fellow continually says bad things about this holy Temple and about the laws that Moses received from God.
47005018	Faith	This complete change in our lives is all something that God does. It is God who made it possible for us to have a peaceful relationship with him. He was able to do that because of what Christ did for us. Now God has sent me, and those who work with me, to tell people that they can have a peaceful relationship with him.
59005010	Recommendation	My fellow believers, as an example of how to be patient, ◄consider/think about► the prophets whom the Lord God sent long ago to speak his messages [MTY]. Although people caused them to suffer much, they endured it patiently.
44002021	Faith	Before that time, all those who ask me [MTY] to save them from the guilt of their sins will be saved { I, the Lord, will save all those who ask me [MTY] to save them from the guilt of their sins.}’ ”
66007012	Faith	They said, “May it be so! We(exc) praise, thank, and honor you, our (exc) God, forever! We(exc) acknowledge that you are completely wise, the powerful one, who is able to do all things forever! ◄It is so!/Amen!►”
60003003	Recommendation	Do not be trying to make yourselves beautiful by decorating the outside of your bodies, such as ◄by the way you comb your hair/by your hair style► or by wearing gold jewelry and fine clothes.
55001008	Faith	So never be ashamed/reluctant to tell others the message about our Lord. And do not be ashamed of me, even though I am a prisoner because I preach about him. Instead, be willing to suffer as I do as you proclaim the message about Christ. Endure what you will suffer by letting God empower you to endure it.
43017019	Description	I dedicate myself to completely belong to you, in order that they also may truly be dedicated {dedicate themselves} completely to you.”
66003002	Recommendation	Become aware of your spiritual need as though you were awaking from sleep [MET], and strengthen yourself spiritually, because you are so useless that you are like someone who is about to die [MET]. You must do this because I know that my God considers that nothing that you do is satisfactory.
66016004	Description	The third angel poured out on the rivers and water springs the wine/liquid [MTY] that was in his bowl. As a result, the water in the rivers and springs turned into blood.
45005002	Faith	Because of what Christ has done, God has also enabled us to begin experiencing his continually acting toward us in ways that we do not deserve. Also, we rejoice because we are confidently expecting that God will gladly show us how great he is.
49005005	Sin	You can be sure of this: No person who is sexually immoral or who acts indecently/shamefully will be among those people whom God rules over [MET] in heaven. Neither will those who desire more things than they need. Such people worship their possessions instead of worshipping God.
58011008	Faith	It was because Abraham trusted God that when he was called {when God called him}, he obeyed God, he left his own country, and went to a place that God would give him. Abraham left his own country, even though he did not know where he would be going.
49005018	Recommendation	Do not become drunk by drinking alcoholic drinks, since people are unable to control their behavior when they are drunk. Instead, let God's Spirit control your behavior at all times [MTY].
61002002	Sin	And many people will behave in an extremely immoral manner, imitating the extremely immoral manner in which these teachers of false teaching behave. As a result, unbelievers will ◄discredit the true message/say the true message is false►.
49002018	Faith	We know that he has done that because we both, Jews and non-Jews, are now able to approach God the Father in prayer by the help of his Spirit, because of what Christ has done.
44021025	Recommendation	As for the non-Jewish believers, we elders here in Jerusalem have talked about which of our laws they should obey, and we (exc) wrote them a letter, telling them what we decided. We wrote that they should not eat meat that people have offered as a sacrifice to any idol, that they should not eat blood from animals and that they should not eat meat from animals that people have killed by strangling them. We also told them that they should not have sex with someone to whom they are not married.”
44005003	Sin	Then Peter said, “Ananias, you (sg) let Satan completely control you [MTY] so that you (sg) tried to deceive the Holy Spirit and us(exc). ◄That was terrible!/Why did you do such a terrible thing?► [RHQ] You have kept for yourself some of the money you (sg) received for selling the land, pretending that you(sg) were giving us all of it.
49004014	Recommendation	Then we will no longer be spiritually immature, like [MET] little children are immature. We will no longer be constantly changing what we believe, like [MET] waves of the sea are constantly changing as the wind blows and tosses them back and forth. We will not allow people who teach what is false and who ◄scheme/try cleverly► to deceive/influence us.
46006009	Sin	◄You should keep in mind that wicked people will not become members of the group over whom God will rule./Do you not know that wicked people will not become members of the group over whom God will rule?► [RHQ] Do not be deceived {Do not deceive yourselves} by thinking wrongly about these matters. People who are sexually immoral, or who worship idols, or who ◄commit adultery/have sex with someone to whom they are not married►, or who happily allow others to commit homosexual acts with them, or who take the initiative in committing homosexual acts,
58010025	Recommendation	We must not cease assembling ourselves to worship the Lord, as some people have done. Instead, each one of us must encourage/exhort the others. Let us do that all the more since we know that the day that the Lord will return [MTY] is near.
51003005	Sin	Get rid of your evil practices/deeds [MET, MTY] as though they were enemies whom you were killing (OR, Get rid of doing evil [MET, MTY], just as dead people do not do what is evil). Specifically, do not practice sexual immorality. Do not commit unnatural sexual acts. Do not desire to act like that, and do not desire to do anything that is evil. Do not desire to have more things than you need, because, if you do that, you are ◄worshipping material things instead of worshipping God/making material things to become your god►.
52005008	Faith	But we believers are people who should do what is right [MET], so we must be self-controlled, as people in the daytime are usually not drunk and are able to control what they do [MET]. As Roman soldiers protect themselves by putting on breastplates and helmets [MET], we believers must protect ourselves by continuing to trust and love the Lord Jesus and by continuing to confidently expect that he will save us from God's punishing us at the time when he will punish other people.
55001007	Grace	Remember that God has put his Spirit within us. His Spirit does not cause us to be afraid. Instead, he causes us to be powerful to work for God, and he helps us to love others and to control what we say and do.
62002004	Sin	Those who say, “We ◄know/I have a close relationship with► God,” and do not obey what God commands us to do, are liars. They are not conducting their lives according to God's true message.
50002002	Faith	make me completely happy by doing the following things: Agree with one another, love one another, be closely united with one another, and live harmoniously with one another [DOU].
43007030	Description	Then they tried to seize him because he said that he had come from God. But no one put their hands on him to do that, because it was not yet the time [MTY] for him to die.
54006018	Recommendation	Also, tell them that their good deeds must be as plentiful as their money. Specifically, they should share very generously with others what they have.
43018030	Description	They knew that Jesus had not disobeyed any Roman law, so they did not want to answer him. Instead, they said, “If this man were not a criminal, we would not have brought him to you!”
45014006	Faith	As for those who believe that they should worship on a certain day of the week, it is to honor the Lord that they worship on that day. And as for those who think that it is all right to eat all kinds of food, it is to honor the Lord that they eat those foods, as is clear from their thanking God for the food that they eat. As for those who abstain from eating certain kinds of food, it is to honor the Lord that they do not eat those foods, and they also thank God for the food that they do eat. So doing either of those things is not wrong in itself.
45012012	Recommendation	Rejoice because you are confidently awaiting what God will do for you! When you suffer, be patient! Keep praying and never give up!
44024023	Description	Then he told the officer who was guarding Paul to take Paul back to the prison and make sure that Paul was guarded all the time. But he said that Paul was not to be chained {that the officer was not to fasten chains on him}, and if his friends came to visit him, the officer should allow them to help Paul in any way that they wished.
46013007	Description	Those who truly love others patiently endure the faults of others. They do not quickly assume that others have done something bad. They confidently expect that others will act righteously. They patiently endure all their own troubles.
47004013	Faith	We are not discouraged. We are like the person who wrote in the Scriptures, “ God, I trusted in you and so I continue speaking your message.” We (exc) also trust in God, so we continue speaking his message.
52005014	Recommendation	My fellow believers, we urge that you warn believers who will not work in order to ◄ obtain/earn the money to buy► things that they need to live. Tell them that they are behaving wrongly. We urge you that you encourage believers who are fearful (OR, discouraged), and that you help all people who are weak in any way. We also urge you to be patient with everyone.
66016010	Description	When the fifth angel poured out on the throne of the beast the wine/liquid that was in [MTY] his bowl, it became dark in the kingdom that the beast ruled. As a result, the beast and the people whom it ruled were biting their tongues because they were suffering intense pain.
48006016	Grace	I pray that God will give inner peace and act kindly towards all who will act according to this new way of life. It is all those who live according to this new way of life who are now truly God's people [MET], as the Israelite people were God's people previously.
44018025	Faith	Other believers had taught him some things about how the Lord Jesus desires that people should conduct themselves, and he taught those things very enthusiastically to people. He had heard some of the things that Jesus did and said, and he taught those facts accurately to people. However, he was teaching incompletely about Jesus, because he knew only what John the Baptizer had taught people whom he baptized.
46010031	Recommendation	So I say to you in conclusion, when you eat food, or drink something, or do anything else, do everything in order that people will praise God.
62002027	Recommendation	As for you, God's Spirit, whom you received from Christ, remains in you. So you do not need anyone to teach you anything else that they claim/say is the truth. God's Spirit is teaching you all of God's truth that you need to know. God's Spirit is truthful and never says anything that is false. So continue to conduct your lives in the way that he has taught you.
59002026	Faith	Remember that when our spirits permanently leave our bodies, our bodies are dead and useless. Similarly [SIM], if someone says, “I trust in God,” but does not do things to help others, what that person says about trusting in God is useless.
44027035	Description	After Paul had said that, while everyone was watching, he took some bread and thanked God for it. Then he broke the bread and began to eat some of it.
44015020	Sin	Instead, we should write a letter to them requiring only four things: They should not eat meat/food that people have offered to idols, they should not have sex with someone to whom they are not married, they should not eat meat from animals that have been killed by being strangled { people have strangled}, and they should not eat the blood of animals.
44023003	Sin	Then Paul said to Ananias, “God will punish you (sg) for that, you hypocrite [MET]! You sit there and judge me, using the laws that God gave Moses. But you yourself disobey those laws, because you commanded me to be struck { these men to strike me} without having proved that I have done anything that is wrong!”
45008001	Description	Because God has erased the record of our sins because we trust in what Christ has done for us, now God will not condemn and punish those/us who have a relationship with (OR, are united to) Christ Jesus.
52005009	Grace	When God chose us, he did not plan for us to be people whom he will severely punish [MTY]. On the contrary, he decided that he would save us because of our trusting in what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us.
66020008	Violence	He will go out to deceive the rebellious people in nations [IDM] all over the earth. These are the nations that the prophet Ezekiel called Gog and Magog. Satan will gather them to fight against God's people. There will be so many of them fighting against God's people that no one will be able to count them [SIM], just like no one can count the grains of sand on the ocean shore.
46006011	Grace	Some of you previously did things like that. But God has freed/cleansed you [MET] from your sinful behavior. He has set you apart for himself. He has erased the record of your sins because you trusted [MTY] in the Lord Jesus Christ and because of what the Spirit of our God has done for you.
55001012	Faith	So, even though I suffer here in this prison, I am not ashamed of being here (OR, I am very confident), because I know Christ Jesus, the one whom I have trusted, and I am convinced/sure that he is able to keep safe the good message that he has entrusted to me (OR, the things that I have entrusted to him), and that he will reward me at the time [MTY] when he comes again.
49006018	Faith	As you are doing that, keep praying to God at all times, and requesting him to do things for you and others; and let God's Spirit direct what you pray. For this purpose, always be spiritually alert/watchful, and ◄always be persistent in/never quit► praying for all God's people.
52001001	Grace	I, Paul, am writing this letter. Silas and Timothy are with me. We(exc) are sending this letter to you who are the congregation of believers in Thessalonica city. We (inc) all worship (OR, trust in) God our Father [MET] and our Lord Jesus Christ. We three desire/pray that God, our Father, and Jesus Christ, our Lord, will continue to act kindly toward you and will continue to cause you to have inner peace.
50004005	Faith	Act in such a way that everyone can know that you are gentle. The Lord is near (OR, coming soon).
46011026	Faith	Remember that until the Lord Jesus returns to the earth, whenever you eat the bread that represents his body and drink the wine [MTY] that represents his blood, you are telling other people that he died for you.
59005015	Faith	And if they truly trust in the Lord when they pray [PRS], the sick person will be healed. The Lord will heal him. And if that person has sinned ◄ in a way that caused him to be/and because of that he became► sick, if he ◄ confesses what he did/says that he did what is wrong►, he will be forgiven { the Lord will forgive him}.
55001003	Faith	I thank God for all that he has done for you. I serve him, and my ancestors served him, too. I serve him in a manner that I know to be right. I thank him while repeatedly I pray for you at night and during the day.
66006016	Description	They shouted to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us (exc) and hide us (exc) in order that the one who sits upon the throne will not be able to see us (exc) [MTY], and in order that the one who is like a lamb will not be able to punish [MTY] us (exc)
66002017	Description	Everyone who wants to understand [MTY] must listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit speaks to the congregations. To everyone who conquers Satan, I will give blessings that will be like the food called manna that is in a jar that is {that someone has} hidden. I will also give them a white stone on which I will engrave a new name, a name that no one but the ones who receive it will know.’ ”
61002003	Sin	Because the teachers of false teaching want a lot of things that other people have, they think that by telling you stories that they themselves have ◄made up/invented►, they will get money from you. God decided long ago that he would punish them, and he has not fallen asleep [LIT]! He will certainly destroy them.
53002011	Sin	So, God, by his power, will enable this man to easily deceive them, so that they will believe what this man falsely claims/says that he is.
45002024	Sin	You must not be like our ancestors, about whom were written these words in the Scriptures: “The non-Jews speak evil about God because of the evil actions of many of you Jews.” They non-Jews say God must be a hypocrite if he condones the behavior of people like you.
55003008	Sin	Just like Jannes and Jambres long ago very much opposed Moses, so also some people now oppose the true message. Those people think only what is evil. God rejects them because they do not believe what is true.
66003019	Recommendation	Since I rebuke and correct all those whom I affectionately love, earnestly turn away from your sinful behavior.
45005001	Faith	Because we trusted in Christ, the record of our sins has been erased { God has erased the record of our sins}. So we now have a peaceful relationship with God because of our trust in what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us.
54004016	Recommendation	Be careful that you conduct yourself well. By continuing to do that, you will save yourself. And if you continue to teach the good doctrine/teaching, the result of your teaching will be that God will save the people who listen to you.
44026011	Violence	Many times I punished the believers whom I found in Jewish meeting places. By punishing them, I tried to force them to speak evil about Jesus. I was so angry with the followers of Jesus that I even traveled to other cities to find them and do things to harm them.”
48005019	Sin	You already know how people think and act [PRS] because of their self-directed nature. These are some of the things that they do: People are sexually immoral. People commit unnatural sexual acts. People act indecently.
46003007	Grace	So the person who first preaches God's message to people is not important, and the person who later teaches people more of God's message is not important, just like [MET] it is not the person who plants the seeds or the person who waters the plants who is important. Instead, it is God, who causes plants to grow and who causes people to grow spiritually, who is important.
46001007	Faith	As a result, while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to return, within your group you truly possess [LIT] every ability that God's Spirit gives to believers.
66014002	Description	I heard a sound from heaven, which was as loud [SIM] as the sound of a huge waterfall (OR, a great/wide river of rushing water) and which was as loud as [SIM] mighty thunder. The sound that I heard was like the sound that people make when they are playing their harps.
44010043	Faith	All of the prophets who wrote about the Messiah long ago told people about him. They wrote that if people believe in the Messiah [MTY], God would forgive them for their sins, because of what the Messiah would do for them.”
45002007	Faith	Specifically, some people, by persevering in doing good deeds, strive to be highly honored by God [DOU] and to receive a life that will not end. God will reward them by enabling them to live forever.
66001004	Grace	I, John, am writing this to you believers in the seven congregations that are located in Asia province. I pray that God the Father, God's Spirit, and Jesus Christ may act kindly toward (OR, bless) you and cause you to have inner peace. God the Father is the one who exists, who has always existed, and who will always exist. The Spirit of God, who is in front of God's throne, has all kinds of power (OR, The Spirit of God is symbolized by seven spirits who are in front of God's throne).
44019004	Faith	Paul said, “John baptized people who turned away from their sinful behavior. He also told the people to believe in the one who would come after he had come, and that was Jesus.”
61002009	Violence	And since the Lord God rescued Lot, you can be sure that he knows how to rescue ◄godly people/people whose lives please him► from their sufferings, and he is able to keep ◄ungodly people/people whose lives do not please him►, whom he has started to punish even now, until the time when he will finish judging them and punish them.
58011016	Grace	But, instead, they desired a better place in which to live; that is, they desired a home in heaven. So God has prepared a city for them to live with him, and he is pleased [LIT] for them to say that he is their God.
54004007	Recommendation	You must completely reject godless, silly/foolish stories from your ancestors that old people tell. Keep training yourself so that you have more ◄godly behavior/behavior that pleases God►.
66020009	Violence	They will march over the whole earth and will surround the camp of God's people in Jerusalem, the city that God loves. Then God will send fire down from heaven, and it will burn them up.
44010048	Description	Then Peter told those non-Jewish people that they should be baptized to show that they had believed [MTY] in the Lord Jesus Christ. So they baptized all of them. After they were baptized, they requested that Peter stay with them several days. So Peter and the other Jewish believers did that.
45002019	Grace	You are certain that you are able to show God's truth to non-Jews, as guides show the road to those who are blind [MET]. You are certain that by what you say you can show God's way to the non-Jews who do not understand it, as a light shows the way to those who walk in the darkness [MET, DOU].
62002025	Grace	And what God told us is that he will cause us to live forever!
59003017	Description	But when people are wise [PRS] in the way that God [MTY] wants them to be, they are pure in every way, which God considers to be very important. They also act peaceably towards others, they ◄are considerate of/think about the rights and feelings of► others, they are willing to yield to the wishes of others, they act compassionately toward others, and they do all kinds of good things for others [MET]. How they treat others does not depend on ◄others' status/whether others are important or not►, and they are sincere in all they do.
43003035	Faith	God loves his Son, and has caused him to have control/power over everything.
61003009	Grace	Therefore, you should not think that because Christ has not yet come back to judge people, the Lord God is ◄delaying/slow to do► what he promised. Some people think that this is so, and they say that Christ never will come back. But you should understand that the reason why Christ has not yet come back to judge people is that God is being patient towards you, because he does not want anyone to be lost eternally. Instead, he wants everyone to turn away from their sinful behavior.
46007007	Grace	I myself wish that all people would stay unmarried/single, as I am. But God has enabled each person to live in different ways. He has enabled some people to live without getting married, and he has enabled other people to get married.
46014001	Recommendation	You must want to love others more than you want anything else. But you should also eagerly desire the abilities that God's Spirit gives to believers. And you should desire most of all to have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God [MTY].
47004006	Grace	When God created the world, he commanded the light to shine where there was nothing but darkness. He is the one who has made his message about Jesus to be like [MET] a light shining into our (inc) minds. God has done that for all of us who believe in Jesus. He has done that so that we will understand that when people saw Christ, they saw how awesome God himself was.
44018024	Description	While Paul was traveling in Galatia and Phrygia, a Jewish man whose name was Apollos came to Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria city. He spoke eloquently and he knew the Scriptures thoroughly.
58013012	Grace	Similarly, Jesus suffered and died outside the gate of Jerusalem in order that he might make us, his people, holy by offering his own blood as a sacrifice to atone for our sins.
56002015	Recommendation	Teach the believers these things! Urge them to do them! Correct those who do not obey them! As you do this, you have my full authority; so do not allow anyone to disregard you!
62004009	Grace	I will tell you how God has shown us that he loves us: He sent ◄his only Son/the only one who was also God► to live on the earth to enable us to live eternally as a result of our trusting in what he accomplished for us by dying for us.
43017024	Grace	My Father, I want the disciples you have brought to me to some day be with me in heaven, where I will be. I want them to see my greatness. I want them to see the greatness you gave me because you loved me. You gave me that greatness before you created the world.
45003016	Sin	Wherever they go they ruin everything and make people miserable [MTY].
58004014	Faith	We have a great high priest who ascended through the heavens when he returned to God's presence. He is Jesus, ◄God's Son/the man who is also God►. So let us firmly profess what we believe about him.
61001017	Grace	God, our Father, greatly honored him when God's great glory/brightness surrounded him, and God [MTY] said, “This is my Son, whom I love very much; I am very pleased with him.”
46012011	Description	It is the same one Spirit who gives all these abilities. He gives whatever abilities he wants to give, to whatever person he wants to give them.
66008012	Description	When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, God struck the sun, the moon, and the stars, so that they lost a third of their light. The sun also did not shine during a third of the day, and the moon and stars did not shine during a third of the night.
44018017	Violence	Then the mob grabbed the leader of the Jewish meeting place, Sosthenes. They beat him, right there in front of the courthouse. But Gallio did nothing about it.
43010039	Violence	After they heard that, they tried to seize him again, but he got away from them.
47004016	Faith	So, because we know that as a result of our suffering many people will honor God, we (exc) never get so discouraged that we stop teaching his message. Although our bodies are getting weaker, God encourages us every day and strengthens us in our inner beings/hearts.
43012003	Description	Then Mary took a bottle of expensive perfume called nard and poured it on Jesus' feet to honor him. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. The whole house was filled with the beautiful smell of the perfume.
58011009	Faith	It was because Abraham trusted God that he lived as though he was a foreigner in a land that God had promised to him. Abraham lived in tents, and his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob did also. God promised to give to Isaac and Jacob the same things that he promised to give Abraham.
50003017	Recommendation	My fellow believers, all of you should unitedly imitate me, and observe those people who act as I do, in order that you may imitate them also.
48006002	Recommendation	When there are ones who have problems, you should help each other. By doing that, you will complete what Christ requires.
59002024	Faith	From the example of Abraham, you can realize that it is because people do good deeds that God considers them to be righteous, and not only because they trust in him.
45009014	Faith	Someone might say, “◄Is God unjust by choosing the ones he wants to choose?/I think that God is unjust by choosing the ones he wants to choose!►” [RHQ] I would reply, “ He is certainly not unjust!”
45014001	Recommendation	Accept those who are not sure whether God will permit them to do certain things some people think are wrong. But when you accept them, do not argue with them about what they think/their opinions.
66012007	Violence	There was a battle in heaven. Michael and the angels that he commanded fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back against Michael and his angels.
49004026	Recommendation	If you get angry, do not sin as a result of getting angry. Before the end of the day [MTY], stop being angry
60003009	Recommendation	When people do evil things to you or insult you, do not ◄retaliate/repay them by► doing evil things to them or insulting them. Instead, ask God to bless them, because that is what you have been chosen by God {what God called you} to do, in order that you may receive a blessing from him.
43008029	Grace	He is the one who sent me, and he helps me. Because I always do the things that please him, he has never abandoned me.”
49006014	Recommendation	You must be ready to firmly resist the devil and his evil spirits [MET], just like soldiers must be ready to resist the enemy. Prepare for doing that by doing these things: To be strong spiritually, hold firmly to God's truth, just like soldiers prepare ◄to stand firm against/to firmly resist► their enemies by fastening their belts around their waists [MET]. Act righteously in order to protect yourself against demonic attacks, just like soldiers put on breastplates to protect their chests against his enemies' attacks [MET].
66001020	Description	The meaning of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands that you saw is this: The seven stars in my hand represent the leaders, who are like angels, who watch over the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands represent the seven congregations.”
58002009	Grace	But we do know about Jesus, who truly has authority over everything! Jesus, the creator of everything, is the one who died for us, makes us holy, and proclaims us to be his brothers and sisters. Hebrews 2:9b-13 Jesus, for a little, while became inferior in rank to angels in order to die on behalf of [MET] everyone. He became inferior when he suffered and died, as God in his kindness planned. But now he has been greatly honored [DOU] by being crowned as kings are.
50002013	Grace	You are able to do these things, since God himself causes you to desire to do what he wants you to do, and he also enables you to do what he wants you to do.
43015011	Grace	I have told you these things so that you may be joyful as I am joyful, and that you may be completely joyful.
54001001	Description	I, Paul, am writing this letter. You know that I am an apostle. I represent Christ Jesus because God and Christ Jesus commanded me to do it. God is the one who saved us, and Jesus is the one for whom we are confidently waiting to return,
54002009	Recommendation	I would like that the clothing that women wear be ◄modest and sensible/proper and appropriate► [DOU]. I want them to not fix their hair in fancy/elaborate ways, nor wear gold jewelry, nor pearls, nor expensive clothing in order that they may make themselves attractive.
43002015	Violence	Then Jesus made a whip from some cords and used it to chase out the sheep and cattle from the Temple courtyard. By overturning their tables he scattered the coins of the men who were exchanging them.
49002010	Grace	It is God who has made us what we are now. Because of our relationship with Christ Jesus, he has enabled us to receive spiritual/eternal life in order that we should conduct our lives habitually doing the good deeds that God previously planned for us to do.
60004012	Recommendation	You whom I love, do not be surprised about the painful things that you are suffering because you belong to Christ. Those things are testing you as metals are tested by people putting them in a fire. Do not think that something strange is happening to you.
66019007	Recommendation	We should rejoice, we should be extremely glad, and we should honor him, because it is now time for Jesus, the one who is like a lamb, to be united permanently with his people, which will be like a man [MET] marrying his bride, and because those who belong to him have prepared themselves to be united with him.
49006017	Recommendation	And rely/depend on the fact that God has saved you, in order to protect yourselves against demonic attacks, just like soldiers put on a helmet to protect their heads from attacks by their enemies [MET]. And be ready to use the weapon that God's Spirit has given you, which is the message of God, in order to fight against ◄ demonic powers/Satan►, just like soldiers use their swords to fight against their enemies [MET].
44007024	Violence	He saw an Egyptian beating one of the Israelites. So he went over to help [MTY] the Israelite man who was being hurt/beat {whom the Egyptian was hurting/beating}, and he ◄got revenge on/paid back► the Israelite man by killing the Egyptian who was hurting/beating him.
53003013	Recommendation	Fellow believers! Do not ever get tired of doing what is right!
46016013	Faith	Be on guard against anything that would hinder you spiritually. You have believed the true message; continue believing it firmly. Be courageous. Keep strong in your relationship with God.
44007043	Sin	On the contrary, you carried with you from place to place the tent that contained the idol representing the god Molech that you worshipped. You also carried with you the image of the star called Rephan. Those were idols that you had made, and you worshipped them instead of me. So I will cause you to be taken away { people to take you} from your own country. You will be taken { They will take you} far from your homes to regions even farther than Babylon country.”
53002015	Recommendation	So, our fellow believers, continue to be firm concerning what you believe; that is, continue believing the true teaching that we committed/taught to you by our speaking to you and by our writing a letter to you.
47005005	Grace	It is God himself who has prepared us to receive these new bodies. He is also the one who has guaranteed/assured us (inc) that this will happen. He has guaranteed it by sending his Spirit to live inside us now.
54002011	Recommendation	Women must learn to listen quietly during the worship services and to fully subject themselves to the leaders of the congregation.
54005019	Recommendation	When some person accuses an elder about doing wrong, accept what he says only if there are at least two or three persons who ◄testify/say that► they saw him do that wrong.
45016016	Recommendation	Greet one another affectionately, but in a pure way, when you gather together. The believers in all the Christian congregations [HYP] in this area ◄send their greetings to/say they are thinking fondly of► you.
66018019	Description	They will throw dust on their heads to show that they are sad, and they will shout, weep, and mourn [DOU]. They will say, ‘Terrible things have happened to the awesome/great cities, the cities that made all people who own ships that sail on the ocean become rich by carrying their costly ◄things to sell/merchandise►! God has suddenly and swiftly destroyed [MTY] those cities!’ ”
62003001	Grace	Think about how much our heavenly Father loves us! He allows us to ◄say that we are/be called► his children! And it is indeed true that we are his children. But people in the world [MTY] who are unbelievers have not understood who God is. So they do not understand who we are, that we are God's children.
60005005	Recommendation	Now I will say this to you young men and women. Just like married men and women are ◄ to be subject/to submit themselves► to their spouses, you must ◄be subject/submit yourselves► ◄to the older men/to the leaders► of the congregation. And all of you believers should act [MET] humbly toward each other, because this proverb is true, God opposes people who are proud, but he acts kindly toward those who are humble.
45003004	Faith	I would reply, “No, it certainly does not mean that! God always does what he has promised, even though people do not. All those who accuse God of not keeping his promises to us Jews are very mistaken.” What King David wrote about God's justly saying that he would punish him for his sins is also true of those who accuse God of not keeping his promises. What he said to God was, “So everyone must acknowledge that what you (sg) have said about them (OR, their sin) is true, and you will always win the case when you are accused {when people accuse you}.”
44009014	Violence	And the chief priests have authorized him to come here to Damascus in order to seize all of us who believe in you (sg) [MTY] and take us to Jerusalem!”
61002001	Sin	Just like there were false prophets among the Israelite people long ago, so there will also be teachers of false teachings among you. They will enter your congregations without you realizing what/who they are, and they will spiritually injure some people by what they teach. Specifically, these teachers will even deny that the Lord Jesus died to pay for the guilt of our sins. As a result, they will soon destroy themselves spiritually, and God will also punish them.
43005018	Violence	The Jewish leaders [SYN] considered that he was disobeying their rules about ◄the Sabbath/the day of rest►, and that by saying that God was his Father, he was making himself equal with God. And they considered that both these things were grounds for killing him. So they sought even harder for a way to kill him.
46011002	Faith	I praise you because you remember all the things that I taught you and because you follow the instructions that I gave you. You have done just like I told you to do.
44002025	Faith	“ Long ago King David wrote what the Messiah said, I knew that you, Lord God, would always be near me. You are right beside [MTY] me, so I will not be afraid of those who want to harm me.
60001023	Grace	I ask you to do this, because you now have a new life [MET]. It was not by means of something that will perish that you received this new life. Instead, it was by means of something that will last forever; that is, by believing the life-giving and enduring message of God.
59005016	Recommendation	So, because the Lord is able to heal the sick and to forgive sins, tell each other the sinful things that you have done, and pray for each other in order that you may be healed {that God may heal you} physically and spiritually. If righteous people pray and ask fervently for God to do something, God will act powerfully and will certainly do it.
43006047	Faith	Listen to this carefully: Everyone who believes ◄ my message/in me► has eternal life.
43014018	Grace	When I leave you, I will not let you be alone/helpless [MET]. When I send the Spirit, it will be like I am coming back to you (OR, When I rise from the dead, I will come back to you.)
45003002	Grace	I would reply that being Jews benefits us in many ways [HYP]. First of all, it benefits us because it was to our ancestors that God's words, words that contain his promises, were given {that God gave his words, words that contain his promises}.
49006005	Recommendation	You slaves, obey those who are your masters here on the earth. Obey them very respectfully and sincerely [DOU], just like you obey Christ.
45002004	Grace	And you should not say, “God is acting very tolerantly and patiently toward me, so I do not need to turn away from my sin [DOU].” ◄You should realize that God is acting in a kind manner toward you in order to encourage you (sg) to turn away from your sinful behavior!/Do you not realize that God is acting in a kind manner toward you in order to encourage you (sg) to turn away from your sinful behavior?► [RHQ]
62005014	Faith	Because we have a close relationship with him, we are very confident that he hears us when we ask him to do anything that is in accordance with ◄his will/what he desires►.
45015013	Faith	God is the one who causes you to be confidently expecting him to do what he has promised. I pray/ask that he will cause you to be completely joyful and peaceful as you trust in him. As you do that, the Holy Spirit will enable you to more and more confidently expect to receive what God has promised you.
43019041	Description	Close to the place where Jesus was crucified {where they nailed Jesus to the cross} there was a grove of trees, and at the edge of that grove was a new burial cave. Nobody had ever been put in that cave previously.
66019020	Violence	The beast and the false prophet were captured { He captured the beast and the false prophet}. The false prophet is the one who had performed miracles in the beast's presence. By doing that he had deceived the people who had accepted the beast's mark on their foreheads and who worshipped its image. The beast and the false prophet were thrown { He threw the beast and the one who falsely said that he spoke messages that came directly from God} alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
45012020	Recommendation	Instead of doing evil to those who have done evil to you, do as the Scriptures teach: “If your (sg) enemies are hungry, feed them! If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. By doing that, you (sg) will cause them to feel ashamed and perhaps they will change their attitude toward you [IDM].”
51003016	Recommendation	And continue to let the message about Christ govern/direct all you think and do, as you very wisely teach and warn one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs (OR, songs that God's Spirit gives you), while you sincerely and thankfully sing to God.
51003019	Recommendation	You men, love your wives; in particular, do not be harsh with them.
54005016	Recommendation	If any woman who believes in Christ has widows in her household/family, she should take care of them. The congregation should not be burdened by having {She should not depend on the congregation} to take care of their needs. The congregation should take care of the widows who truly have no one to care for them.
62005011	Grace	This is what God says to us: “I have given you eternal life!” We will live forever if we have a close relationship with his Son.
62005012	Faith	Those who have a close relationship with God's Son (OR, who have accepted what God's Son has done for them) have already begun to live forever. But those who do not have a relationship with ◄God's Son/the one who is also God► (OR, who have not accepted what God's Son has done for them) have not begun to live forever.
43008036	Grace	So if you allow me to free you, you will truly be free.
49003013	Faith	So I ask that you do not be discouraged because of my suffering many things for you here in prison. You should feel honored that I am willing to suffer these things for your sake.
45016018	Sin	They do not serve our Lord Christ! On the contrary, they only want to satisfy their own desires [MTY]! Also, by all the eloquent things that they say [DOU] they deceive the minds of those people who do not realize that their teaching is false.
45001029	Sin	They strongly desire to do all kinds of unrighteous deeds. They strongly desire to do all kinds of evil things to others. They strongly desire to possess things that belong to others. They strongly desire to harm others in various ways. Many non-Jews are constantly envying other people. Many constantly desire to murder people. Many constantly desire to cause strife between people. Many constantly desire to deceive others. Many constantly desire to speak hatefully about others (OR, to speak harmful things about others, things that are not true). Many gossip about others.
55001014	Recommendation	Do not let anyone persuade you to change the good message that God has entrusted/given to you. Allow the Holy Spirit who lives in us to direct what you say.
48006008	Faith	God will punish eternally those who do what their self-directed natures urge them to do. But those who please God's Spirit will live forever with God because of what God's Spirit does for them.
46010009	Recommendation	We should not try to see how much we can sin without the Lord punishing us. Some of them did that, and as a result they died because poisonous snakes bit them.
46013005	Recommendation	Those who [PRS] truly love others do not act in disgraceful/disrespectful ways towards them. They do not ◄act selfishly/think only of themselves and what they want►. They do not quickly become angry. They do not keep remembering the bad things that others have done to them.
66009009	Description	They wore metal breastplates. When they were flying, their wings made a noise like a roar when many horses pull chariots as they are rushing into battle.
43015022	Sin	If I had not come and spoken God's message to them, they would not be guilty of rejecting me and my message. But now I have come and told them God's message, so they will have no excuse when God judges them for their sin.
51004005	Recommendation	Act wisely towards those who do not believe in the Lord Jesus [MTY]; use every opportunity to do that.
45006006	Faith	We must keep remembering that when Christ died on the cross [MET], it was as though our sinful nature died with him. It has lost its power to make us do what it wants us to do [MET]. That happened in order that we would not do the sinful things that our bodies [MET], which desire to sin, want us to do, and in order that we would no longer have to sin [MET], as slaves have to do what their masters want.
62003010	Sin	Those who are God's children are clearly different from those who are ◄the devil's/Satan's► children. The way that we can know who are Satan's children is this: Those who do not do what is right are not God's children. Specifically, those who do not love their fellow believers are not God's children Instead, they are Satan's children.
45008007	Sin	Let me explain this. To the extent that people [PRS] think about and are concerned about what their self-directed nature desires, they are acting contrary to God. They do not obey the laws of God. In fact, they are not even able to obey his laws.
44002026	Faith	Because of that I [SYN] joyfully praise you, O God. And I am completely confident that you(sg) will ◄ cause my body to become alive again/ raise me from the dead►.
46010020	Sin	No! Instead, I mean that what people sacrifice to idols, they are sacrificing to demons, not to God. So, if you eat food that has been sacrificed to idols, you are participating in worshipping the demons that the idols represent. And I do not want you to participate in worshipping demons!
44013001	Description	Among the people in the congregation at Antioch in Syria province there were ◄prophets/those who spoke messages from God► and those who taught people about Jesus. They were Barnabas; Simeon, who was also called Niger/Blackman; Lucius, from Cyrene city; Manaen, who had grown up with King Herod Antipas; and Saul.
49005006	Recommendation	Do not let anyone deceive you by suggesting that God will really not punish people who commit such sins, because God certainly will punish [MTY] those who habitually disobey him by doing such things.
56001011	Sin	You and the leaders whom you appoint should prevent such people from teaching the believers. They are causing whole families to stop believing in the correct teachings [MET] by means of their teaching people wrong ideas/teachings. They are teaching people only in order that people will give them money, which is very shameful for them to do.
43013011	Sin	He knew which one of us was going to betray him. That is the reason he said, “Not all of you are free from guilt.”
43010001	Sin	Jesus continued by saying to us, “Listen carefully to what I say. Anyone who does not enter the sheep pen through the gate, if he climbs in some other way, he is a thief or a bandit.
61002015	Sin	They have ◄rejected good moral standards/quit doing what everyone knows is right►. They have imitated what the prophet Balaam, the son of Bosor, did long ago. He, acting very unrighteously, wanted the enemies of the Jews to pay him if he asked God ◄ to curse/to do bad thing to► the Jews.
44014005	Violence	Then the non-Jewish people and the Jewish leaders [SYN] who opposed those two talked among themselves about how they could mistreat them. Some of the important men in that city agreed to help them. Together, they decided that they would kill Paul and Barnabas by throwing stones at them.
43021017	Description	Jesus said to him a third time, “John's son Simon, am I really dear to you (OR, do you really love me)?” Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him this three times, and because the third time he changed the question. He said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said, “Give to those who belong to me what they need spiritually, as [MET] a shepherd provides food for his sheep.
66021027	Sin	No one who is morally impure, no one who does deeds that God considers detestable, no one who tells lies, will ever enter that city. Only those people whose names are written in the book of the one who is like a lamb {whose names the one who is like a lamb has written in his book}, the names of people who have eternal life, will be there.
66017004	Sin	The woman that I saw was wearing purple and red clothes; and gold, precious stones, and pearls were fastened to her clothes and her body. She held in her hand a golden cup. The cup was full of a liquid that represents [SYM] the detestable/disgusting, idolatrous things and filthy immoral things that she does.
51003014	Recommendation	And what is more important than all of these is that you love one another, because by doing that you will be perfectly united together.
43012023	Description	Then, to show them that he must die in order to give eternal life to non-Jews like those Greeks, Jesus replied to them, “It is time for God to honor me, the one who came from heaven. That will happen when I die.
45002022	Sin	You who command people not to have sexual relations with someone to whom they are not married, ◄it is disgusting that it you commit adultery yourself!/why do you commit adultery yourself?► [RHQ] You who detest idols, ◄it is disgusting that you rob temples where people worship idols!/why do you rob temples where people worship idols?► [RHQ]
45007008	Sin	And because of what that commandment stated, my sinful desire to have things that belong to others [PRS] caused me to covet in many ways. Our desire to sin is not stimulated [MET] when there is no law that prohibits our doing sinful things.
44026017	Grace	I will protect you from those who will try to harm you, both your own people and also those who are not Jewish. I am sending you to them
56003003	Sin	Remind your congregations about these things because formerly we believers ourselves were also foolish, just like all people who do not believe in Christ are now. We did not obey ◄ God/God's message►. We let others deceive us. We ◄spent all our time doing/continually did► what is evil and could not stop ourselves from doing all the things that our bodies liked [DOU]. We were ◄envying others/desiring to have what others have►. We were causing people to hate us and we were hating one another.
54005021	Recommendation	I solemnly tell you that as you keep in mind that God and Christ Jesus and the holy angels know everything that you do, obey these commands about elders! As you consider what others say about an elder doing wrong, do not easily/quickly decide that what they say is true. And treat them all equally.
58010035	Recommendation	So, do not become discouraged when they cause you to suffer { you are persecuted}, because if you continue to trust in God, he will greatly reward you.
46004002	Faith	With respect to doing that, those who are given work are required {give others some work to do require them} to do that work faithfully.
44009043	Description	Peter stayed in Joppa many days with a man named Simon who made leather from animal skins.
46003016	Grace	◄You need to remember that God is present among you (pl) as he was present in the Temple in Jerusalem./Do you not know that God is present among you (pl) as he was present in the Temple in Jerusalem?► [RHQ] God's Spirit lives within you.
58010019	Faith	So, my fellow believers, because we trust in what Jesus accomplished when his own blood flowed for us, we can confidently go into God's very presence that was symbolized by the very holy place in the tent [MTY].
43008021	Sin	Jesus also said to them, “I will soon be going away. Then at the end of your life you will seek me, but you will die without God forgiving your sins. Where I will go, you will not be able to come.”
51003012	Recommendation	Because God has chosen you and reserved you to be his people, and because God loves you, be compassionate to one another. Be kind to one another. Be humble. Be meek (OR, be considerate toward one another), be patient with one another,
43012026	Faith	If any of these Greeks or anyone else wants to serve me, they must become my disciples. Then, after they die, they will be where I am, in heaven. My Father will honor all those who serve me.
54003004	Description	He must lead and care for his own household/family well. For example, he must be a man whom his children obey and completely respect,
52005011	Recommendation	Because you know that this is true, continue to encourage/comfort each other, as indeed you now are doing.
62003011	Recommendation	The message that you heard when you first [MTY] believed in Christ is that we should love each other.
46007026	Recommendation	There are a lot of distressing events happening now (OR, that will soon happen), so I think that it is better for people to remain in the status that they now have.
43003001	Description	There was a man named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish religious council. He belonged to the Pharisee religious sect.
59002025	Description	Similarly, it was certainly [RHQ] because of what Rahab did, that God considered her to be a righteous, obedient person. Rahab was previously a prostitute, but she cared for the Israelite men who came to ◄ spy out the land/see what that area was like► and she helped them to escape by sending them home on a different road from the one that they came on.
54002015	Faith	But even though she did that, now women will be saved {God will accept women} as they bear children if they continue to trust God and if they continue to love others, and if they continue to conduct their lives more and more ◄acceptably to God/like God wants them to►, and if they continue to be modest.
44013017	Grace	God, whom we (inc) Israelites worship, chose our ancestors to be his people, and he caused them to become very numerous while they were foreigners living in Egypt. Then after many years, God helped them [MTY] powerfully and led them out of there.
44015008	Grace	God knows and judges people according to what they think, not according to who their ancestors were. By sending the Holy Spirit to the non-Jews, just like he had also done for us (inc) Jews, he showed me and others that he had accepted them also to be his people.
59002011	Sin	For example, God said, “Do not commit adultery,” but he also said, “Do not murder anyone.” So if you (sg) do not commit adultery but you (sg) murder someone, you (sg) have become a person who disobeys God's laws.
43010028	Grace	I will give them eternal life. No one will separate them from me, not ever. No one shall ever pull them away from belonging to me.
45016020	Grace	If you avoid people who teach what is false, what will soon happen [MET] will be as though God, who causes us to be peaceful, will be crushing Satan under your feet! I pray that our Lord Jesus will continue to act kindly towards you.
55003005	Sin	And, although they will pretend that they worship God, they will not let God's Spirit work powerfully in their lives. Do not associate with such people (OR, Do not let such people join your congregation),
45012005	Description	Similarly we, although we are many, are united into one group because of our relationship with Christ, and we belong to one another. So no one should act as though he needed by God more than the others!
56003008	Faith	These words that I have said are trustworthy. So, I want you to confidently teach the things that I have written about in this letter to those who have trusted in God, in order that they will be constantly devoted/attempting to do deeds that are good and helpful for others. Have nothing to do with foolish disputes about genealogies and about the Jewish law; and do not allow divisive people who have turned away from the true teachings to influence the believers. Titus 3:8b-11 These teachings are beneficial and profitable for all people,
59002023	Faith	And so it happened as it is written in the Scriptures: “Because Abraham truly trusted in God, he was considered by God to be { God considered that he was} righteous.” And God also said about Abraham, “He is my friend.”
59002001	Faith	My fellow believers, because you trust our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who is glorious/wonderful, stop honoring some people more than others.
45003013	Sin	What people say [MTY] is foul/bad, like the smell that comes from a grave that has been {that people have} opened [MET]. By what people say [MTY], they deceive people. By what they say [MTY] they injure people, just like the poison of snakes injures people [MET].
49005028	Recommendation	In the same way, each man should love his wife as he loves his own body. Men who love their wives, it is as though they love themselves.
45009030	Faith	◄We must conclude this:/What shall we conclude?► [RHQ] Although non-Jews did not search out a way by which God would erase the record of their sins, they found that way because they trusted in what Christ did for them.
54003009	Faith	They must sincerely believe the message that God has now revealed to us.
54006002	Recommendation	Slaves who have masters who believe in Christ must not be disrespectful to their masters just because their masters are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve their masters even better because their masters are fellow believers whom God loves and who benefit when the slaves serve them well. As you teach these things to your congregation, exhort/urge people that they do them.
45003003	Faith	Many Jews did not obey God as they promised that they would. So someone might ask, “Does their not being faithful mean that God will not bless us Jews as he promised that he would?”
43019034	Violence	Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear to make sure that Jesus was dead. Immediately blood clots and other liquid flowed out, which showed that Jesus was really dead.
43015012	Recommendation	What I am commanding you is this: Love each other just like I have loved you.
45006013	Recommendation	Do not let any of your body parts do wicked things, as you did [MET] when you were spiritually dead. Instead, present yourselves to God as people who are alive spiritually. Present all your body parts to God, to allow him to use them to do righteous things.
58010039	Faith	But we are not ones who in a cowardly manner cease to trust in God, with the result that God will severely punish us. Instead, we are ones who trust in him, with the result that God will save us [SYN] eternally.
45011026	Grace	And then all [HYP] the people of Israel will be saved { God will save all [HYP] the people of Israel}. Then these words that are written {that a prophet wrote} in the Scriptures will ◄ become true/be fulfilled►: The one who sets his people free will originate from the place where God dwells (OR, from the Jews) [MTY]. Then he will remove the guilt of the Israelite people (OR, descendants of Jacob) [MTY].
52002015	Violence	Unbelieving Jews are the ones whom God considers guilty for killing the Lord Jesus, as well as for killing many prophets. Other unbelieving Jews forced us to leave many towns. They really make God angry; and they are opposed to what is best for all human beings!
58010026	Sin	We(inc) must do those things, because if we deliberately and habitually sin after we have known the true message about Christ, no other sacrifice will remove our guilt for having sinned in this way.
49002006	Grace	And it is as though God gave us spiritual life when he caused Christ Jesus to be alive again after he died [MET]. And it is as though God caused us to sit and rule [MTY] with him in heaven,
49004025	Recommendation	Therefore, quit lying to one another. Instead, because we all belong to just one group of believers, speak truthfully to each other.
48002005	Faith	But not even briefly did we (exc) do what they wanted about circumcision. We(exc) resisted them in order that the truth of the message about Christ might continue to benefit you.
46014013	Recommendation	So, those who have the ability to speak in languages [MTY] that they have not learned should pray that God will give them the ability to explain the meaning of what they say.
44009001	Violence	Meanwhile, Saul angrily continued to say, “I will kill those who believe that Jesus is the Lord!” He went to the high priest in Jerusalem
43017013	Description	Father, now I am about to return to you. I have said these things while I am still here in the world in order that my disciples may fully experience being joyful, as I have been joyful.
60004013	Recommendation	Instead, rejoice that you are suffering the same kinds of things that Christ endured. Rejoice when you suffer, in order that you may also be very glad [DOU] when Christ returns and reveals how glorious/wonderful he is.
44011006	Description	As I was looking intently into it, I saw some tame animals but also animals that our laws forbid us to eat, including wild animals, snakes, and wild birds.
51003008	Recommendation	Now, however, as for you, do not do any of these evil deeds: Do not get angry in any way [DOU]. Do not act maliciously. Do not ◄slander/talk evil about► people. Do not talk abusively to people.
44018003	Description	Those two made tents to earn ◄ money/a living►. Paul also made tents, so he stayed with them and they all worked together.
45006012	Sin	So, do not let the desire to sin [PRS] control your bodies [MET] with the result that you do the sinful things that you desire to do. Remember that your bodies will surely die, but your spirits will never die.
53003012	Recommendation	We command those fellow believers who are not working, and urge them by the authority [MTY] of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they settle down and ◄support themselves by working/work to earn money to buy what they need►.
44007009	Sin	“ You know that Jacob's older sons became jealous because their father favored their younger brother Joseph. So they sold him to merchants/traders who took him [MTY] to Egypt. There he became a slave of an official who lived there. But God helped Joseph.
44011028	Description	One of them, whose name was Agabus, stood up in order to speak. God's Spirit enabled him to prophesy ◄that there would soon be a famine in many countries/that people in many countries [HYP] would soon suffer because they would not have enough food to eat►. (That famine happened when Claudius was the Roman Emperor.)
44020036	Description	When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of the elders and prayed.
48005024	Faith	Furthermore, we who belong to Christ Jesus have stopped obeying our self-directed nature and stopped doing all the evil things that we desire to do [MET]. It is as though [MET] we nailed them to the cross!
59001002	Recommendation	My fellow believers, rejoice greatly, even when you experience various kinds of difficulties/troubles.
62001006	Sin	If we claim to have a close relationship with God, but we conduct our lives in an impure manner, that is like living [MET] in evil darkness. We are lying. We are not conducting our lives according to God's true message.
44010011	Description	◄He saw heaven open/He saw an opening in the sky► and something like a large sheet was being lowered to the ground. It was tied at its four corners with ropes.
44002009	Description	Some of us are from the regions of Parthia and Media and Elam, and others of us reside in the regions of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia.
51001010	Faith	We have been praying that in order that you will conduct yourselves as the Lord's people should conduct themselves, in order that you will please the Lord in every way. Specifically, we have been praying that in order that you will be doing every sort of good deed [IDM] and in order that you will be getting to know God truly, more and more.
54001018	Recommendation	Timothy, you are like [MET] a son to me. So, ◄based on/in accordance with► what someone previously ◄prophesied/told what God revealed to them► about you, I am instructing you to strongly oppose those who teach false doctrines/teachings. You should oppose them like [MET] a soldier ◄fights strongly against/opposes► those who attack his countrymen.
66019001	Faith	After these things I heard what sounded like a huge crowd in heaven. They were shouting things like, “◄Hallelujah!/Praise our God!►” “He has saved us!” “He is glorious and mighty!”
49002001	Grace	Formerly, because you were habitually sinning [DOU], you were ◄ spiritually dead/ as unable to please God as a corpse [MET] is►.
46010021	Sin	When you drink the grape juice/wine in [MTY] the cup at the Lord's Supper, you cannot participate in the blessings that the Lord Jesus brought to us and at the same time drink the wine in the [MTY] cup that people offer to demons! When you eat at the Lord's table, you cannot participate in the blessings the Lord provided [MTY] when he died for us and at the same time participate in the things that represent demons by eating food that has been sacrificed to idols
49005003	Recommendation	Do not commit any kind of immoral act [DOU], and do not desire more things than you need. Do not act in such a way that others could even ◄spread rumors/talk► about your acting in such ways, because it is not appropriate/fitting for God's people to do such things.
56001015	Sin	Believers should reject what they teach about food, because no food that we eat can make us unacceptable to God if we are pure in our ◄ inner beings/hearts►. But if people are evil within themselves and they do not trust in Christ Jesus, there is no ritual that can make them acceptable to God. Such people's way of thinking has been ruined {Such people have ruined their way of thinking}, and they do not even feel guilty when they do what is evil.
44009021	Description	And all the people who heard him preach were amazed. Various ones of them were saying, “◄ We(inc) can hardly believe that this is the same man who persecuted the believers in Jerusalem!/Is this really the same man who persecuted the believers in Jerusalem?► [RHQ, MTY] And we (inc) know that he has [RHQ] come here to seize us and take us to the chief priests in Jerusalem!”
58008006	Description	But now as it is, Christ ministers in a more excellent way than the Jewish priests do. Likewise, the new covenant that he established between God and people is better than the old one. When the new covenant was established { God established the new covenant}, he promised us better things than the laws that God gave Moses did.
50001021	Faith	As for me, I live in order to honor Christ. But if I die, it will be better for me than if I continue to live, because then I will be completely united with him.
50001006	Faith	I am completely confident that God, who has begun to perform in you what is good, (OR, that since God has begun to perform in you what is good, he) will continue to do that until he finishes doing it on the day Christ Jesus [MTY] returns.
62005020	Faith	We also know that ◄God's Son/the one who is also God► has come to us, and we know that he has enabled us to know God, the one who is really/truly God. So now we have a close relationship with God because we belong to Jesus Christ, the one who is the ◄Son of/man who is also► God. Jesus Christ is truly God, and he is the one who enables us to have eternal life.
45012018	Recommendation	Live peacefully with other people whenever it is possible, to the extent that you can control the situation.
58010023	Faith	We must unwaveringly keep professing what we believe. Since God faithfully does all he promised to do, we must confidently expect him to keep doing that.
43014027	Grace	As I leave you, I am causing you to have inner peace. This inner peace comes from me. I am not causing you to have something that those who do not belong to God [MTY] can give you. So stop being anxious/worried, and do not be afraid.
47005006	Faith	So, because God's Spirit lives in us, we are always confident that God will give us new bodies. We know that as long as we live in our bodies here on earth, we are not yet living together with the Lord Jesus in heaven.
43012047	Grace	As for those who hear my message but do not obey its commands, I am not the one who judges them. The main reason that I came ◄ into the world/from heaven► was not to judge the people of [MTY] the world. Instead, I came to save them from being punished for their sins.
62003012	Sin	We should not hate others as did Adam's son, Cain, who belonged to Satan, the evil one. Because Cain hated his younger brother, he murdered him. ◄I will tell you about why he murdered his brother./Do you know why he murdered his brother [RHQ]?► It was because Cain habitually conducted his life in an evil way, and he hated his younger brother because his younger brother conducted his life righteously.
66016020	Description	Also as a result of the earthquake, every island disappeared, and the mountains became flat land.
58011012	Description	So, although Abraham was too old to have children, from that one man people descended who are as many in number as the stars in the sky and are as countless as the grains of sand along the shore, just like God promised him.
54001017	Faith	I desire that people will honor and praise the only true God forever! Even though no one can see him, he is the King who rules for all time, who will never die! ◄Amen!/That is true!►
66014007	Faith	He said in a loud voice, “Reverence God and honor him, because it is now time for him to judge people! Worship God, because he is the one who created the heaven, the earth, the ocean, and the springs of water.”
44006001	Description	During that time, many more people were becoming believers. Some of them were from other countries and spoke only the Greek language, but most of them had always lived in Israel and spoke the Hebrew language. Those who spoke Greek began to complain about those who spoke Hebrew. They were saying. “When you Hebrew-speaking believers distribute food or money to widows every day, you are not giving fair amounts to the widows who speak Greek!”
60002021	Grace	One of the reasons why God chose you is that you would suffer. When Christ suffered for you he became an example for you, in order that you would ◄imitate what/do like► he did.
53003010	Recommendation	Remember that when we were there with you, we kept commanding you that if any fellow believer refuses to work, you should not give him food to eat.
43003016	Grace	God loved us people [MTY] in the world so much that he gave his only Son as a sacrifice for us, in order that everyone who believes in him would not be separated from God forever. Instead, they would have eternal life.
44019015	Description	But one day as they were doing that, the evil spirit refused to come out of that person. Instead, he said to them, “I know Jesus, and I know that he has authorized Paul to expel demons. ◄But no one has authorized you to do anything to me!/who authorized you to do anything to me?► [RHQ]”
66019019	Violence	Then I saw the beast and the kings of earth with their armies gathered together to fight against the rider on the horse, and against his army.
44027002	Description	So we got on a ship that had come from Adramyttium city in Asia province. The ship was going to return there, stopping at cities along the coast of Asia province. Aristarchus, a fellow believer who was from Thessalonica city in Macedonia province, went with us.
58013003	Recommendation	Remember to help those who are in prison because they are Christians, as though you were in prison with them. Remember those who are being mistreated {whom people are mistreating} because they are believers. As you do that, consider that you are also alive [MTY], and you could suffer as they do.
51003017	Recommendation	Whatever you say, and whatever you do, do all of this in the manner that those who are representatives [MTY] of the Lord Jesus should do, while you constantly thank God, our Father, as you ask the Lord Jesus to take your prayers to God.
48006006	Recommendation	You who are being taught {whom others are teaching} God's truth should share your various material things [EUP] with your teachers.
44007005	Description	“ At that time God did not give Abraham any land here, not even a small plot of this land that would belong to him. God promised that he would later give this land to him and his descendants, and that it would always belong to them. However, at that time Abraham did not have any children who would ◄ inherit it/receive it after he died►.”
44007019	Description	That king cruelly tried to get rid of our ancestors. He oppressed them and caused them to suffer greatly. He even commanded them to leave their baby boys outside their homes so that they would die.”
43020003	Description	So Peter and I started going to the cave.
44024016	Faith	Because I am confidently waiting for that day, I always try to do what pleases God and what other people think is right.
65001013	Description	They are restless [MET], like the pounding waves of the ocean. Just like waves produce foul-smelling foam on the shore, those teachers of false doctrine do shameful [MTY] deeds. We cannot depend/rely on them to show us how to conduct our lives [MET], just like we cannot depend/rely on ◄meteors/falling stars► to show us the way when we travel. God has reserved intense darkness for them forever in hell.
48001012	Description	I did not receive this message from a human messenger, and no human being taught it to me. Instead, Jesus Christ revealed it to me.
45007005	Sin	When our self-directed nature controlled us, desires that led us to sin were acting in our bodies. Those desires were increased because of our knowing God's laws [PRS]. As a result we did evil things [IDM] that caused us to be separated from God.
54002007	Faith	As for me, he appointed me to declare this message and to be an apostle. I am telling the truth about God appointing me. I am not lying! He appointed me to teach the non-Jews that they should believe God's true message.
62003024	Faith	Those who do what God commands are ones who have a close relationship with God, and God has a close relationship with them. I will tell you how we can be sure that God has a close relationship with us: It is because we have his Spirit, whom he gave to us, that we can be sure that God has a close relationship with us.
46010024	Recommendation	No one should try to benefit only himself. Instead, each person should try to benefit other people spiritually.
45012016	Recommendation	Desire for others what you desire for yourselves (OR, Live harmoniously with each other)! Do not do things because you want to be famous! Instead, be content to do tasks that others consider that only unimportant people do (OR, to associate with unimportant people). Do not consider yourselves wise.
49004031	Recommendation	Do not be resentful at all towards others. Do not become angry in any way. Never shout abusively at others. Never ◄slander/say bad things about► others. Never act maliciously/be mean in any way.
51001025	Faith	I myself became one who serves God's people, because I was appointed { God appointed me} to be responsible to help you who are non-Jews. I became one who serves God's people in order that I should make known to you non-Jews the whole message from/about God.

47004015	Grace	So I say that all these things that we(exc) suffer are in order to help you. We have suffered all this in order that more and more people, as a result of hearing that God will kindly/freely forgive their sins, will thank him and praise him. Then they will greatly honor him and worship him.
43006056	Faith	Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood will have a close relationship with me, and I will have a close relationship with them.

43021015	Faith	When we had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “John's son Simon, do you love me more than these other disciples do?” Peter said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said, “Give to those who belong to me what they need spiritually, like [MET] a shepherd provides food for his lambs.”
46012008	Grace	To some, the Spirit gives the ability to speak very wise messages. To others, the same Spirit gives the ability to know things that he reveals to them.
44007013	Description	When Joseph's brothers went to Egypt the second time, they again bought grain from Joseph. But this time he told them who he was. And people told Pharaoh that Joseph's people were Hebrews and that those men who had come from Canaan were his brothers.
60003010	Recommendation	Consider what the Psalmist wrote about the proper way of conducting our lives, As for those who want ◄to enjoy life/to live happily► and experience good things happening to them every day, they must not speak [MTY] what is evil or speak [MTY] words that deceive others.

46015003	Grace	The most important part of the message that I received from the Lord Jesus, and that I told you, was this: Christ died to take away the guilt of our sins, as the Scriptures said that he would do.
66018024	Violence	You are also responsible for killing [MTY] the prophets and others of God's people. Indeed, you are the ones who are guilty for the deaths of all those who have been {whom others have} killed on the earth!”
44013048	Faith	While the non-Jewish people were listening to those words, they began to rejoice, and they repeatedly said that the message about the Lord Jesus was wonderful. And all of the non-Jewish people whom God had chosen ◄to have eternal life/to live eternally with God► believed the message about the Lord Jesus.
66022020	Description	Jesus, who says that all these things are true, says, “Certainly I am coming soon!” I, John, reply, “◄May it be so!/Amen!► Lord Jesus, come!”
50004009	Recommendation	Those things that I have taught you and that you have received from me, those things that you have heard me say and that you have seen me do, those are the things that you yourselves should continually do. As a result of your doing those things, God, the one who causes us to have inner peace, will ◄be with/bless► you.
53003015	Recommendation	Do not think of him as though he was your enemy; instead, warn him as you would warn your other fellow believers.
51002008	Recommendation	Make sure that no one forces you (pl) to become his disciples [MET] by his teaching you a religious philosophy/doctrine that is valueless and false. Such a philosophy is false because it teaches what mere human beings think, because it teaches people elementary regulations/rules that are concerned merely with what is external/physical, and because it teaches what is contrary to the true teaching about Christ.
50003014	Faith	Instead, I concentrate only on continuing to become more and more like Christ right up to the end of my life [MET]. As a result, because of my relationship with Christ Jesus, God will call/summon me to receive a reward from him in heaven.
56002014	Faith	He is the one who willingly gave himself ◄ to die/as a sacrifice► on our behalf to set us free from all sinful behavior! He wants ◄us to get rid of all our evil behavior/to make our lives pure► [MET]. He wants us, who are his very own people, to be people who are eager to do what is good.
43005024	Faith	Listen to this carefully: Those who hear my message and believe that God is the one who sent me have eternal life. God will not ◄condemn them/say that he will punish them►. They are no longer separated from God. Instead, they have eternal life.
66021015	Description	The angel who was speaking to me carried a golden measuring rod, in order to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
50003019	Sin	God will severely punish them. The things their bodies desire [MTY] have become like gods to them [MET]. They are proud of the things they should be ashamed of. They think only about what unbelievers [MTY] think about.
54003006	Sin	He must not be one who has just recently trusted in Jesus, because if you choose a man like that he might become conceited/proud because you chose him so soon. As a result of his being conceited/proud, God will condemn him like he condemned the devil because he was conceited/proud.
65001003	Recommendation	You whom I love, I ◄was very eager/very much wanted► to write to you about that which we all ◄share/have in common►, which is how ◄ God/Jesus Christ► has saved us. But now I realize that it is necessary for me to write to you in order to exhort you to defend the truth about Christ that we believe. Jesus and his apostles gave that truth once for all to us who belong to God, and we must not let it be changed { anyone revise/change it}.
44004002	Description	These men were very angry, because the two apostles were teaching the people about Jesus.

45012011	Recommendation	Do not be lazy. Instead, be eager to serve God! Be enthusiastic as you serve the Lord!
60001008	Faith	You love Jesus, although you have not seen him. Although you do not see him now, you rejoice very much [DOU]
62004013	Grace	I will tell you how we can be sure that we have a close relationship with God and that God is within us: He has put his Spirit within us.
43019029	Description	There was a jar of sour wine there. So someone took a stalk of a plant called hyssop and fastened a sponge to it. Then he dipped the sponge into the wine and lifted it up to Jesus' lips.
51001013	Grace	God our Father rescued us spiritually so that the evil one no longer rules us [MET, MTY], and he transferred us spiritually so that his Son, whom he loves, rules us.
45016017	Recommendation	My fellow believers, I exhort you that you beware of those people who are causing divisions among you and who cause people to turn away from God [MTY] because they teach things that are contrary to the message about Christ that you have learned (OR, that others taught you). Keep away from such people!
45012007	Recommendation	Those whom God has enabled to serve others should do that. Those whom God has enabled to teach his truth should do that.
43016023	Faith	When that happens, you will not ask me any questions about anything. Listen to this carefully: After that happens, my Father will do for you anything you ask, because of his relationship with me [MTY].
66021019	Description	The foundations of the wall of the city were beautifully made with wonderful stones that are like precious stones on earth. The first foundation stone was a crystalline stone like jasper, the second foundation stone was a blue stone like sapphire, the third foundation stone was a green stone like agate, the fourth foundation stone was a green stone like emerald,
59004017	Sin	So if anyone knows the right thing that he should do, but he does not do it, he is sinning.
66019005	Faith	Someone spoke from the throne and said, “All you who are his servants, praise our God! All you who reverence him, whether you are socially significant or insignificant, praise him! Everyone!”
47005002	Faith	While we are here on earth, we suffer. We often groan because we desire to go to heaven where God will give us our new bodies [MET].
48006004	Recommendation	Instead, each of you should constantly test/judge and decide if you can approve what you yourself are doing and thinking. Then you can boast because of what you yourself are doing and thinking, and not because what you are doing is superior to what other persons are doing.
46007036	Recommendation	Some of you men have asked about your unmarried daughters. I suggest that if any man thinks that he may be treating his daughter unfairly by keeping her from marrying, and if it is already past the right time for her to get married, and if he thinks that she ought to be married, he should do what he wants to do. He should let her get married. He will not be sinning by doing that.
43016002	Violence	They will not allow you to worship in ◄synagogues/ their meeting places►. In fact, there will be a time when anyone who kills you will think that he is serving God by doing that.
66015001	Description	Something else very unusual appeared in the sky. I saw seven angels, whose duty it was to punish (OR, inflict hardship upon) rebellious people with seven different plagues (OR, in seven different ways). God is so angry with rebellious people that this is the last time that he will punish them with the purpose of giving them an opportunity to turn away from their sinful behavior.
43018023	Description	Jesus replied to him, “If I said something that was contrary to your laws, you could tell me that what I said that was wrong. But because I said only what was right, ◄you should not be striking me!/why are you striking me?► [RHQ]”
50004003	Recommendation	And, my faithful comrade/partner, I request that you (sg) help them to again have a peaceful relationship with each other, because they have faithfully proclaimed the message about Christ together with me, even though many people have opposed us (exc). They have faithfully proclaimed that message together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book in which God has written the names of all those people who will live forever.
66016006	Sin	The rebellious people murdered your holy people and prophets. So you are just in punishing them by giving them blood to drink. This is what they deserve!”
45006002	Sin	I would reply, No, certainly not! We ought to consider that our sinful desires [MET] cannot make us do what they want us to do, just like we cannot make a corpse do what we want it to do. So ◄it is not right that we continue to sin!/how can we continue to sin?► [RHQ]
66017011	Violence	The beast that lived before and then was not alive will be the eighth ruler. He will be evil like the seven rulers were, but God will surely destroy him.
48004030	Recommendation	But these are [RHQ] the words in the Scriptures [PRS]: “The son of the woman who was not a slave will inherit what his father has. The female slave's son will certainly not inherit those things. So send away from this place the female slave and her son [MET]!” That means that you should certainly expel from your groups those who insist that we obey all the laws God gave Moses [MET].
54006009	Sin	But some people strongly desire to be rich. As a result, they do wrong things to get money, and this will cause them to be caught/trapped [MET] as animals get caught in traps. They foolishly desire many things, and those desires cause them to get hurt. And God will completely reject them!
66017016	Violence	The ten horns that you saw represent rulers [SYM]. They and the beast will hate the people in the city [MTY] that the prostitute represents. As a result, they will take away everything that is in the city, as if they were [MET] leaving it naked. They will destroy it as if [MET] devouring flesh/meat, and they will burn it with fire.
46008003	Faith	But as for those who love God, they know that they belong to him.
45003009	Sin	If someone would ask, “ Shall we conclude that God will treat us Jews more favorably and will treat the non-Jews less favorably [RHQ]?” I would reply that we can certainly not conclude that! I have already shown you that all people, the Jews and also the non-Jews, have sinned and so they deserve to be punished { that God will punish them} [PRS].
44007041	Sin	So, they made an image out of gold that looked like a calf. Then they sacrificed animals and offered other things to honor that idol, and they sang and danced to honor the idol that they themselves had made.
66009020	Sin	The rest of the rebellious people, those who were not killed by these plagues of fire and smoke and burning sulfur, did not turn from their sinful behavior. They did not stop worshipping the idols that they had made with their own hands. They did not stop worshipping demons and idols that were made of gold, of silver, of bronze, of stone, and of wood, even though they are idols that can neither see nor hear nor walk.
47005011	Faith	It makes me fearful to think that some day I will stand before the Lord for him to judge me. So I do everything that I can to convince people that they should believe (OR, that I teach sincerely) God's message. God knows very well how I conduct my life and what I teach, and I really believe that you also know it, within yourselves.
49002003	Sin	Formerly, we all used to disobey God as they do. We did the things that our self-centered nature wanted us to do. We habitually did those evil deeds that our bodies and our minds wanted. When we were acting like that, it was certain that God would punish [MTY] us, just like he will certainly punish all other evil people.
44002040	Recommendation	Peter spoke much more and spoke strongly/forcefully to them. He pleaded with them, “ Ask God to save you so that he will not punish you when he punishes these evil people who have rejected Jesus!”
45008013	Faith	If you live the way your self-directed nature directs, you will surely not live eternally (OR, will surely be eternally separated from God). But if by the power of God's Spirit you quit doing the sinful things that your bodies desire [MET], you will live eternally.
45010011	Faith	It is written { Isaiah wrote} in the Scriptures [PRS] about the Messiah, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”
45001008	Faith	As I begin this letter, I thank my God for all you believers in Rome. It is because of what Jesus Christ has done for us that I am able to do that. I thank him because your trusting in Jesus Christ is something that people all over the Roman Empire [HYP] are talking about.
52001004	Faith	My fellow believers whom God loves, we also thank him because we know that he chose you to become his people.
60004008	Recommendation	Most important of all, love each other earnestly/wholeheartedly, because if we love others [PRS], we will just ignore many of the sinful things that they do to us.
44027001	Description	When the Governor and those who advised him decided that it was time for us (exc) to get on a ship and go to Italy, they put Paul and some other prisoners into the hands/care of an army captain whose name was Julius. He was the one who would guard us on the journey. Julius was an officer in charge of a group of a hundred soldiers that people called ❛the Emperor Augustus Group❜.
66015003	Faith	They were singing a song like God's servant Moses sang long ago. They sang like this to praise Jesus, the one who is like a lamb: Lord God Almighty, whatever you do is powerful and marvelous! You always act righteously and truthfully. You are king forever!
60002002	Faith	Just like newborn babies long for their mothers' pure milk [MET], you should long for God's spiritual truth, so that by learning it you may become spiritually mature. You need to do this until the day when God will free you completely from all the evil in this world.
66014013	Faith	I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: God will now abundantly bless the people who have a close relationship with the Lord Jesus for the rest of their lives.” God's Spirit says, “Yes, after they die they will no longer have to work hard. Instead, they will rest, and the record of the good deeds [MTY] that they have done will go with them (OR, God will reward them for the good deeds that they have done).”
59001027	Faith	One of the things that God has told us to do is to take care of orphans and widows who suffer hardship. Those who do that and who do not think or act immorally like those who do not obey God [MTY] truly [DOU] worship God, who is our Father, and God approves of them.
51002004	Recommendation	I am telling you this in order that no one may deceive you by means of arguing persuasively;
66005013	Description	I also heard every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the ocean, every creature in all those places, saying (OR, singing): “We must forever praise and honor the one who sits on the throne and the one who is like a lamb, May they reign with complete power forever!”
66008008	Description	When the second angel blew his trumpet, something that was like a huge mountain burning with fire fell into the ocean. As a result, a third of the ocean became red like [MTY] blood,
44007058	Violence	They dragged him outside the city of Jerusalem and started to throw stones at him. The people who were accusing him took off their outer garments in order to throw stones more easily, and they put their clothes on the ground next to a young man whose name was Saul, so that he could guard them.
45015011	Faith	And Moses wrote in the Scriptures, “Praise the Lord, all you non-Jews, and may everyone praise him [DOU].”
45011036	Faith	God is the one who created all things. He is also the one who sustains all things. The reason that he created them was that everything he created might praise him. May all people honor him forever! ◄May it be so!/Amen!►
43001029	Faith	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him. He said to the people, “Look! Here is the man whom God has appointed to be a sacrifice [MET], like the lambs that the people of Israel sacrificed! By sacrificing himself he will make it possible for everyone in the world to be no longer guilty for having sinned.
58011031	Description	Rahab had been a prostitute, but because she trusted God, she did not perish with those inside Jericho who disobeyed God. Joshua sent some spies into the city in order to find ways to destroy it, but God saved her because she welcomed those spies peaceably.
43010010	Grace	Thieves come to a sheep pen only to steal or kill or destroy sheep [MET]. Similarly, your religious leaders injure God's people spiritually. But I have come in order that people may have eternal/spiritual life, and that they may have abundantly all they need to sustain them spiritually.
50003020	Faith	But remember that we are citizens of heaven. And we eagerly wait for our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, to return from there.
45015007	Recommendation	So I say to all of you believers at Rome, accept each other. If you do that, people will praise God as they see you thus behaving like Christ. Accept each other just like Christ accepted you!
44021024	Recommendation	Go with these men to the Temple and ritually purify yourself along with them. Then, when it is time for them to offer the sacrifices for that ritual, pay for what they offer as sacrifices. After that, they can shave their heads to show that they have done what they promised to do. And when people see you in the courts of the Temple with those men, they will know that what they have been told {what people have told them} about you is not true. Instead, all of them will know that you obey all our Jewish laws and rituals.
45004012	Faith	Likewise, Abraham is the spiritual ancestor of all us Jews who are not merely circumcised but who, more importantly, believe in God's promise as our ancestor Abraham did, even before he was circumcised.
44001026	Description	Then they cast lots to choose between the two of them, and the lot fell for Matthias. (OR, Then one of the apostles shook in a container small objects/stones that they had marked to determine which man God had chosen. And the small object/stone that they had marked for Matthias fell out of the container). So Matthias was considered {they considered Matthias} to be an apostle along with the other eleven apostles.
45004007	Grace	God is pleased with people whose sins have been {whose sins he has} forgiven, and whose sins he has decided to forget [DOU].
66011004	Description	Those witnesses are the ones that are represented by the two olive trees and the two lampstands that are in the presence of the Lord who rules the earth [SYM].
59004009	Recommendation	Be sorrowful and weep/mourn [DOU] because of the wrong that you have done. Do not laugh [DOU], ◄ enjoying only what you selfishly/enjoying only what you yourselves► desire. Instead, be sad because you have done what is wrong.
64001011	Recommendation	Dear friend, do not imitate a bad example like that. Instead, keep imitating good examples. Remember that people who do good deeds ◄ truly belong to God/are spiritual children of God►, but those who do what is evil do not ◄know/have fellowship with► God.
45004011	Faith	Many years later, God commanded that Abraham be circumcised. Abraham's accepting that ritual simply showed that he knew that God had accepted him. He knew that God had erased the record of his sins because he trusted in God while he was still, in effect, a non-Jew because he had not been circumcised. So we can understand that Abraham became ◄a spiritual ancestor/like an ancestor► to all of us whose record of sins has been erased {whose sins God has erased the record of} because we believe in God's promise, even though some of us are not circumcised.
45006007	Grace	We are, as it were, freed { free} from sinful desires [MET] controlling us, just like those who have died are free from anything controlling them.
47004010	Faith	Wherever we(exc) go, we continually realize that because people killed Jesus, people may kill us for teaching his message. But we are willing to go on living this way in order that people will know that Jesus is alive and that he is directing us [SYN].
50002021	Sin	All the others whom I have considered that I might send to you are concerned only about their own matters. They are not concerned about what Jesus Christ considers important.
58011011	Faith	It was because Abraham trusted God that God gave Abraham strength so that he was able to produce a son. Even though his wife Sarah was beyond the time when women bear children, God promised that he would give her a son, and Abraham considered that God would do what he promised to do.
43006039	Grace	What the one who sent me wants is that I ◄keep forever all/never lose any► [LIT] of those whom he has entrusted to me. He wants me to cause all of them to become alive again ◄on the last day/on the day when I judge everyone► [MTY].
46008006	Faith	But for us believers there is only one real God. He is our heavenly Father who created everything. He is the one whom we worship and serve. Also, for us believers Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord. He is the one whom God caused to create everything. It is because of what he has done that we have spiritual life.
52003006	Description	Now Timothy has just returned to Silas and me from being with you, and he has told us the good news that you still trust in Christ and that you love him (OR, each other). He told us also that you always happily remember us and that you strongly desire that we visit you, just like we strongly desire to visit you.
60005004	Grace	If you do that, when Jesus, who is like our chief shepherd [MET], appears, he will give each of you a glorious/wonderful reward [MET]. That reward will be like the wreaths that are given to victorious athletes, but your reward will never wither like wreaths do.
47003012	Faith	We (exc) know that the message that we teach is a much more wonderful message than the message that Moses taught. So we can preach boldly.
61002012	Sin	Because those teachers of false doctrines are like animals that cannot think as humans do [DOU], they say evil things about spiritual things concerning which they know nothing. As a result, God will destroy them like people destroy animals, animals that are born only in order to be captured and destroyed {in order that people should capture and destroy them}.
43012006	Sin	He said that, not because he cared about the poor people, but instead, because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the bag of funds that people gave to help Jesus and us his disciples, and he often stole some of the money that was {that people} put into it.
62004016	Faith	We have experienced how God loves us and we believe that he loves us. As a result, we love others. Because God's nature is to love people, those who continue to love others have a close relationship with God, and God has a close relationship with them.
44011019	Description	After people had killed Stephen, many of the believers left Jerusalem and went to other places because people were causing them to suffer there in Jerusalem. Some of them went to Phoenicia region, some went to Cyprus Island, and others went to Antioch city in Syria province. In those places they were continually telling people the message about Jesus, but they told only other Jewish people.
54006006	Faith	Well, we truly do gain great benefit when we conduct our lives ◄in a godly manner/in a manner that pleases God► and we are content with what we have.
66013007	Violence	It was allowed { God allowed it} to fight against God's people and to conquer them. It was allowed { God allowed it} to have authority to rule over every tribe, over every people- group, over speakers of every language [MTY], and over every nation.
60002020	Faith	God will certainly not [RHQ] be pleased with you if you do something that is wrong and as a result you are beaten {someone beats you}! But if, instead of doing wrong, you do what is good, and as a result of that, you suffer for doing what is good, and you endure that suffering, God will ◄commend/be pleased with► you.
58009015	Grace	By dying for us, Christ ◄ redeemed/set free from the penalty for their sins► even those who disobeyed the conditions of (OR, during the time of) the first covenant. So, because no one could be made perfect by obeying the old covenant, now Christ establishes between God and people a new covenant. He does that in order that those whom God has chosen may eternally have the blessings that God has promised them.
45006001	Sin	Someone might [RHQ] say in reply to what I have written that since God acted kindly toward us in a way we did not deserve because we sinned, ◄perhaps we should continue to sin in order that he may continue to act even more kindly toward us and keep on forgiving us./should we continue to sin in order that he may continue to act even more kindly toward us and keep on forgiving us?► [RHQ]
49005004	Recommendation	Do not use obscene/shameful language when you talk to people. Do not talk foolishly. Do not use vulgar/indecent language, because it is not appropriate/fitting that God's people should talk like that. Instead, tell people how much you thank God for all he does for you.
66006008	Violence	This time I saw a pale horse come out. The one who sat on it is named ❛ The one who causes death [PRS]❜, and the one that is named ❛The place where dead people go❜ accompanied him. God gave them authority over one quarter of the people on earth to incite them to kill each other with weapons [SYN], and also authority to kill them ◄by means of their causing them to lack food/by famine►, by means of their causing them to become sick from epidemics, and by means of their causing wild animals to attack them.
45004016	Faith	So it is because we trust in God that we will receive the things that he has promised. It is not because we perfectly obey God's laws. He wants ◄to erase the record of our sins/to declare us no longer guilty► without our earning it. As a result, what God now promises, he guarantees to give to all people who are Abraham's spiritual descendants. He promises to do that not only for us Jewish believers, who have God's laws and trust in him as Abraham did, but also for those non-Jews who do not have God's laws but who trust in him as Abraham did. Abraham is the spiritual ancestor of all of us believers.
44028018	Description	The Roman authorities/officials questioned me and wanted to release me, because I had not done any bad thing for which I should be executed {they should kill me}.
45009016	Grace	So God chooses people, not because they want God to choose them or because they try hard to do things so that he will accept them. Instead he chooses people because he himself has mercy on undeserving ones.
46010008	Sin	We should not have sexual relations with someone to whom we are not married, as many of them did. As a result, God punished them by causing twenty-three thousand people to die in only one day.
45007023	Sin	Nevertheless, I sense that there is a different force that is in ◄my body/me► [PRS, SYN]. It is opposed to what with my mind I desire to do [MET], and it puts me inescapably under the control of [MET] the sinful desires that I have [SYN].
58006001	Faith	So, we (inc) must not keep discussing the elementary principles about Christ. Instead, we must proceed to the teaching that will make us spiritually mature [MTY]. We must not be people who always need someone to teach them the elementary truths about Christ that are like [MET] a foundation. I am referring to the teaching that people who do sinful things, things that those who are spiritually [MET] dead do, must turn away from their sinful behavior. I am referring to the teaching that people must believe in God.
46016011	Recommendation	Do not let anyone despise him. And when he leaves there, give him some of the things that he needs for his trip [EUP] here, and also ask God to bless him. I am waiting for him to come, along with the other fellow believers who have been traveling with him.
59002014	Faith	My fellow believers, there are some people who say, “I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,” but they do not do good deeds to other people. ◄Their saying that will certainly not do them any good!/What good will their saying that do for them?► [RHQ] ◄ God will certainly not save people like that who say that they believe, but do not do good deeds!/Will God save people like that who say that they believe, but do not do good deeds?► [RHQ]
43007025	Description	Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, “◄This is the man that they are trying to kill!/Isn't this the man that they are trying to kill?► [RHQ]
43020022	Faith	After saying that, he breathed on us and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit!
45010003	Sin	They did not ◄submit themselves to/accept► the way that God erases the record of people's sins. They did not want to recognize that way because they wanted him to do it their own way.
62005010	Faith	Those who trust in the Son of God know within their ◄inner beings/hearts► that what God says about his Son is true. But those who refuse to believe that what God says is true are saying that God is a liar, because they refuse to believe what God has said about ◄his Son/the one who is also God►.
43014012	Faith	Listen to this carefully: You who trust in me will do the kinds of miracles that I have done. Because of what I will do for you (OR, Because I will send God's Spirit to you) after I go to my Father, you will be able to do miracles that will be greater than the ones I have done.
56002009	Recommendation	As for slaves, specifically, urge them to be submissive to their masters in everything. They should please their masters; specifically, they should not ◄ contradict/refuse to obey► their masters.
58012015	Recommendation	Beware that none of you stops trusting in God, who has done kind things for us that we did not deserve (OR, Beware that you have never experienced God kindly saving you). Be on guard lest any of you act evilly towards others, because that will grow like [MET] a root grows into a big plant, and the result of your doing that will be that many believers will sin and become unacceptable to God.
54003007	Recommendation	Moreover, an elder must conduct himself in such a way that non-Christians speak well of him, because if he conducts himself like that, people will not ◄reproach/say evil things about► him, and the devil will not capture/trap him [MET] like people capture animals in a trap.
49004007	Grace	Christ has generously given to each one of us spiritual gifts, just like he decided to give them.
66016003	Description	The second angel poured out on the ocean the wine/liquid that was in [MTY] his bowl. As a result, the water in the ocean stank like the blood of a person who has died. And [MTY] every living creature that was in the ocean died.
49006006	Recommendation	Obey them, not only when they are watching [MTY] you, and not only to cause them to think highly/well of you. Instead, obey them as though you were [MET] slaves of Christ, not slaves of your masters. Do enthusiastically what God wants you to do.
60003016	Recommendation	But answer them humbly and respectfully, and make sure that you ◄do/have done► nothing wrong, in order that those who speak evil about you may be ashamed when they see the good way in which you are conducting yourselves because of your relationship with Christ.
43006040	Faith	Long ago in the desolate area when those who were bitten by snakes looked at the bronze replica of a snake, they were healed [MET]. What my Father wants is that similarly everyone who looks at what I have done and believes in me will have eternal life. I will cause them to become alive again ◄on the last day/on the day when I judge everyone► [MTY].”
44012023	Violence	So, because Herod let the people praise him instead of praising God, immediately an angel from the Lord God caused Herod to become seriously ill. Many worms ate his intestines, and soon he died very painfully.
47001003	Grace	We should praise God, who is the father of our (inc) Lord Jesus Christ. He always pities us and helps us because he is like [MET] a father to us and we are like his children. He always encourages us (inc).
54001006	Sin	There are some people who have turned away from these true teachings. As a result, they just discuss what is useless.
45001016	Faith	That leads me to say that I very confidently proclaim [LIT] the good message about what Christ has done, because this good message is the powerful means that God uses to save from the guilt of their sins all people who trust in what Christ has done for them. Specifically, God first saves the Jews who believe the good message, and then he saves non-Jews.
46003011	Description	Just like people can put in only one foundation for a house [MET], there is only one message that we can give to people. That message is about Jesus Christ.
49005033	Recommendation	However, as for you, each man must love his wife just as he loves himself, and each woman must respect her husband.
51002013	Grace	And specifically, you who are non-Jews, because of your sins, you were spiritually dead before you trusted in Christ. You were uncircumcised spiritually; that is, your self-directed nature controlled you. Nevertheless, it was you whom God caused to become alive spiritually [MET] with Christ. And specifically, God forgave us all our sins.
54004014	Recommendation	Do not neglect to use the abilities that God gave to you as a result of people/us ◄prophesying/telling what God revealed to them► about you and as a result of the elders putting their hands on you to commission/appoint you to do God's work.
66021001	Description	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and the oceans no longer existed.
52005016	Recommendation	Be joyful ◄at all times/always►,
66009006	Description	During the time when the locusts torture rebellious people, the pain will be so bad that people will want to find a way to die, but they will not find [PRS] any way. They will long to die, but they will not be able to die [PRS].
52004014	Faith	We believers know that it is true that Jesus died and that he rose to live again. So we also know well that God will cause those believers who died [EUP] to live again. We know that he will cause them to go to heaven (OR, come) with Jesus as a result of God's commanding them to arise and ◄ go to/come with► Jesus.
62004015	Faith	So those who affirm/say that Jesus is the ◄Son of/one who is also► God, God is within them, and they have a close relationship with God.
49004022	Recommendation	You were taught { They taught you} that you must put aside [MET] your evil nature; that is, that you must not behave like you formerly did. Your evil desires deceived you, making you want to do evil things and causing you to think that doing that was good for you; and your thinking like that was destroying you spiritually.
43010009	Grace	I am like a gate. Those will be saved { God will save all those} who come to God by trusting in me. Just like sheep go in and out through the gate safely to find pasture [MET], I will provide for them and protect them.
58011037	Violence	Some of those believers were stoned to death {People killed some of those believers by throwing stones at them}. Others were cut completely in two. Others were killed with swords. Others of these people who trusted God wandered around the land wearing garments made only of skins from sheep and goats. They did not have any money. They were continually oppressed and tormented {People continuously oppressed them and tormented them}.
62002029	Faith	Since you know that Christ always does what is right, you know that all those who continue doing what is right are the ones who have become children of God.
44013047	Grace	We are doing that also because the Lord God has commanded us to do it. He said to us, ‘I have appointed you to reveal things about me to non-Jewish people [MET] that will be like a light to them. I have appointed you to tell people everywhere [MTY] in the world about the one who came to save them.’ ”
47004002	Faith	And I have determined that we (exc) will be honest [LIT] in everything that we do. We will not do anything that would cause us to be ashamed if people found out about it. We never try to deceive you with clever arguments, as some other people do. We never try to deceive you by changing God's message, as those same people do. Instead, we always teach people only the truth about Christ, and we teach it clearly. Knowing that God is watching what we do, we teach his message in an honest way, with the result that no one can accuse us (exc) of being deceitful.
44002033	Description	God has greatly honored Jesus by causing him to rule right beside him [MTY] in heaven. Jesus has received the Holy Spirit from God his Father, just like God promised. So Jesus has generously/abundantly given us the Holy Spirit, and he has shown that by what you are seeing and hearing.
51003010	Recommendation	and because you have received a new nature. God is causing your new nature to become more and more like his own nature. He created your new nature in order that you might get to know God truly.
43011004	Faith	They hoped that Jesus would come , but when Jesus heard the message, he said, “His being sick will not end in his dying. Instead, it will result in people realizing how great God is, and that I, God's son, may be honored {that people may honor me, God's son}, because of what I will do .”
45001017	Faith	By means of this good message God reveals how he erases the record of people's sins (OR, declares people no longer guilty for having sinned); and his doing this is entirely because [IDM] they trust in Christ. This is confirmed by what a prophet long ago wrote that God said, “Those ◄whose record of sin I have erased/whom I have declared no longer guilty for sin► because they trust in me will live forever.”
43019017	Description	As they left, he himself was carrying the cross on which they were going to nail him. They went to a place called The Place of a Skull. In the Aramaic language it is called {they call it} Golgotha.
45012006	Faith	Instead, since each one of us can do various things that differ according to the abilities that God has given to us, we should do them diligently and cheerfully! Those whom God has enabled to speak messages from him should speak what corresponds to what they believe God told them.
66004007	Description	The first living creature was like a lion. The second living creature was like an ox. The third living creature had a face like a man's face. The fourth living creature was like an eagle that was flying. Each of the four living creatures had six wings. They were covered with eyes, all around their bodies and under their wings. Day and night they continually [LIT] sing: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty One. He is the one who has always existed, who exists now, and who will always exist.
49005015	Recommendation	So be very careful how you behave. Do not behave as foolish people do. Instead, behave as wise people do.
45010012	Grace	God treats the Jews and the non-Jews similarly. Because he is the same Lord for all people who believe in him, he abundantly blesses all who ask him to help/save them.
45010004	Faith	They wanted God to erase the record of their sins as a result of their obeying his laws. But because of what Christ has done, it is no longer necessary for people to obey the laws God gave Moses in order for the record of their sins to be erased. Now God will erase the record of sins of everyone who trusts in what Christ has done.
50004006	Recommendation	Do not worry about anything. Instead, in every situation, pray to God, tell him what you need, and ask him to help you [DOU]. Also thank him for what he does for you.
46010006	Faith	Those things that happened long ago became examples to teach us the following things: We should not desire to do evil things as those people desired to do.
66009002	Description	When he opened that shaft, smoke arose from it like smoke from a great burning furnace. The smoke prevented anyone from seeing the light of the sun and the sky.
52004006	Recommendation	God wants each one of you to control your sexual desires, in order that no one of you sin against your fellow believer and take advantage of him or her by doing things like that. Remember that we strongly warned you previously [DOU] that the Lord Jesus will punish all people who do sexually immoral acts.
47005017	Faith	The fact is that God makes every one of us who trusts in Christ to be completely different than we were before. Our old way of conducting our lives is gone. We now have a completely new way of conducting our lives.
43005020	Faith	My Father loves me, and he shows me everything that he is doing. He will show me the miracles that he wants me to do that will be greater than the ones that you have already seen me do, so that you may be amazed.
49004028	Recommendation	Those who have been stealing must not steal any longer. Instead, they should work hard to earn ◄their living/what they need► ◄ by their own efforts/ by what they do themselves► [MTY], in order that they may have something to give to those who are needy.
57001022	Recommendation	Also, keep a guest room ready for me to stay in, because I confidently expect that as a result of your prayers for me, I will be released from prison and will come to you all.
58013009	Recommendation	So, do not let yourselves be diverted {let anything divert you} so that you believe various teachings that are contrary to God's truth. It is good that God acts kindly toward us so that we may be strengthened spiritually. Obeying rules about various foods, rules that have not benefited those who obeyed them, will not benefit us.
52005012	Recommendation	My fellow believers, we three ask that you recognize/honor as leaders those people who work hard for you. Specifically, respect those who lead you as fellow believers who ◄have a close relationship with/are united to► the Lord Jesus. They warn you to stop doing what is wrong (OR, they teach you to do what is right).
43009022	Description	The Jewish leaders [SYN] had previously declared that they would prevent anyone who declared that Jesus was the Messiah from entering their synagogues. His parents knew that, so they were afraid of the Jewish leaders [SYN].
50003003	Faith	Those people think that they are God's people because someone has circumcised them. But we, not they, are truly God's people [MET], whether or not someone has circumcised us. God's Spirit enables us to [MTY] worship God; we praise Christ Jesus because he has enabled us to become the people of God. We do not believe that God will consider/make us his people as a result of what someone has done to our bodies [MTY, SYN].
62003023	Faith	I will tell you what he commands us to do: We must believe that Jesus Christ is ◄his Son/the one who is also God►. We must also love each other, just like he commanded us to do.
66013011	Description	I saw another beast, which was coming up from the earth. It had two small horns on its head like a sheep has. But it spoke things to deceive people, like the dragon does.
46014020	Recommendation	My fellow believers, stop being like little children in the way that you think about these abilities that God's Spirit gives. Instead, think about them in a mature way. If you really want to be like little children, do as few wicked things as babies do!
59005013	Recommendation	Whoever among you is experiencing trouble [RHQ] should pray that God would help him. Whoever is cheerful/happy [RHQ] should sing songs of praise to God.
58012012	Recommendation	So, instead of acting as though you were spiritually exhausted, renew yourselves [MET] spiritually.
60001017	Recommendation	God is the one who ◄impartially/without favoritism► judges what each one does. Since you call him ❛Father❜, conduct yourselves ◄reverently/with great respect for him► during the time that you are living here on earth. While you are living here, you are like exiles/foreigners [MET] because you are away from heaven, which is your true home.
58010036	Recommendation	You must patiently continue to trust in him in order that, because of your doing what God wants you to do, he will give you what he has promised.
58011001	Faith	It is because people trust God that they are sure that they will receive the things that they confidently expect God to give them. They are also certain that they will see those things happen, though no one sees them yet.
49004017	Recommendation	By the authority of the Lord Jesus, I strongly ◄affirm/tell you► that you must no longer conduct your lives like unbelievers do. The futile/worthless way in which they think [MET] controls how they conduct their lives.
51002016	Recommendation	So disregard anyone who says that God will punish you because you eat certain foods and because you drink certain drinks or because you do not celebrate special yearly festivals or celebrate the time when the new moon appears or weekly ◄Sabbaths/Jewish days of rest►.
66007015	Faith	Because of this, they are in front of God's throne, and they serve him day and night in his heavenly temple. God, the one who sits on the throne, will shelter/protect them [MTY].
44020010	Description	Paul also went down. He lay down and stretched out on top of the young man and put his arms around him. Then he said to the people who were standing around, “Do not worry, he is alive again now!”
55002010	Faith	Therefore I willingly endure all that I am suffering for the sake of those whom God has chosen. I do this in order that Christ Jesus will save them, too, and that they will be forever with him in the glorious place where he is.
60005014	Recommendation	Greet each other with a kiss on the cheek to show that you love each other. I pray that God will give inner peace to all of you who have a relationship with Christ.
49005021	Recommendation	Humbly submit yourselves to each other because you reverence Christ, who is our example.
61003017	Recommendation	Therefore, dear friends, since you already know about these teachers of false teachings, ◄guard against them/beware►. Do not let these wicked people deceive you by telling you things that are wrong, with the result that you yourselves begin to doubt what you now firmly believe.
51003018	Recommendation	You women, be subject to your husbands, since that is what you should do because you have a close relationship with the Lord Jesus.
54005020	Recommendation	But as for any elder who repeatedly sins, rebuke him before the whole congregation, in order that the rest of the elders will be afraid to sin.
45014013	Recommendation	Since it is God who will judge everyone, we must stop saying that God should punish some of our fellow believers! Instead, you/we should decide that you/we will not do anything that would be an example that might cause fellow believers to stop trusting in God [DOU].
45002010	Grace	But God will greatly reward spiritually [MET, DOU] every person who habitually does good deeds. He will certainly do this for the Jews because God chose them as his special people, but he will also do it for the non-Jews.
58011034	Violence	Some forced lions to keep their mouths shut. Some escaped from being destroyed by fire. Some of those people escaped from being killed with a sword [MTY]. Some of those people who trusted God were made strong {became mighty} again after they had once been weak. Some became powerful when they fought wars. Some caused armies that came from foreign lands to run away from them.
48006017	Faith	Finally, I say that people have persecuted me/caused me to suffer for declaring the truth about Jesus, and as a result I have scars on my body. Your new teachers do not have scars like mine! So do not trouble/bother me about these matters again!
66018021	Violence	Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large stone for grinding grain, and he threw it into the ocean. Then he said, “O you people in [APO] the awesome/great cities represented by Babylon, your cities will be destroyed so that they will disappear just like that stone disappeared in the ocean! Your cities will be gone forever [LIT]!
65001020	Faith	But you people whom I love, ◄establish yourselves/continue to trust► firmly in the very sacred truths that you believe. Pray by letting the Holy Spirit enable/empower you.
45012002	Recommendation	Do not let anything non-Christian determine how you should act. Instead, let God change your way of life by making your way of thinking new, in order that you may know what he wants you to do. That is, you will know what is good, and you will know what pleases God, and you will know how to be all that he wants you to be.
46015009	Sin	The fact is, I consider that I am the least important of the apostles. I do not deserve to be an apostle, because I ◄persecuted God's groups of believers/caused God's groups of believers to suffer► everywhere I went.
62002015	Recommendation	Do not desire to conduct you lives in the evil manner in which godless people in the world [MTY] conduct their lives, and do not love anything that the evil people in the world [MTY] consider to be good. Those who desire to conduct their lives in the evil manner in which other people of the world [MTY] conduct their lives do not really love God, their Father, at all.
45002001	Sin	God will severely punish non-Jewish people who habitually do evil deeds, because he has clearly revealed that he is angry with them. So, when God judges people, he will not excuse any one of you Jews to whom I am writing. You (sg) say that God should punish non-Jews for doing evil deeds. But when any one of you says that, it is yourself whom you are saying that God should punish, because you (sg) do some of the same evil deeds that the non-Jews do.
48002009	Description	And those leaders knew that God had kindly given to me this special work. So James, Peter, and John, the ones whom your new teachers respect because they are leaders [MET] of the believers, shook hands with us [IDM] to show that they agreed that Barnabas and I are serving the Lord just like they are, and that we are preaching the same message that they are preaching. They also agreed that we (exc) are the ones whom God was sending to tell his message to non-Jews, but that God is sending them to tell his message to Jews [MTY].
43019023	Description	After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier. But they kept his cloak separate. This cloak had been woven from top to bottom from one piece of cloth.
45002021	Sin	Since you claim that you have all these advantages because you are a Jew, ◄it is disgusting that you who teach other people that they should obey the laws God gave Moses do not obey the laws that you yourself teach!/why is it that you who teach other people that they should obey the laws God gave Moses do not obey the laws that you yourself teach?► [RHQ] You who preach that people should not steal things, ◄it is disgusting that you yourself steal things!/why do you yourself steal things?► [RHQ]
46006019	Faith	◄Keep in mind that your bodies are like [MET] temples of the Holy Spirit./Do you not know that your bodies are like [MET] temples of the Holy Spirit?► [RHQ] The Spirit, whom God gave you, lives within you. You do not belong to yourselves. You belong to God,
47005014	Grace	I speak and act the way I do because the love that Christ has for people influences me in everything that I say and do. When he died, he suffered the punishment for the sins of all people. So, we should all think of ourselves as having died with him, being as unresponsive to sinful desires as [MET] a corpse is.
58003001	Faith	My fellow believers, God has set you apart and has chosen you, just like he chose me. So consider Jesus. He is God's messenger to us. He is also the high priest whom we say we believe in.
44020035	Recommendation	In everything that I did, I showed you that we (inc) should work hard in order to have enough money to give some to those who are needy. We (inc) should remember that our Lord Jesus himself said, ‘You are happy when people give you what you need, but God will be happy with you when you give other people what they need.’ ”
58013004	Recommendation	You must ◄respect/keep sacred► the marriage relationship in every way, and you must keep sexual relations [EUP] pure, because God will surely condemn those who act immorally and those who act adulterously.
43020005	Description	I stooped down at the entrance and looked inside. I saw the strips of linen cloth lying there where his body had been laid, but I did not go inside.
66016018	Description	When the angel emptied his bowl, lightning flashed, there were rumblings and thunder, and the earth shook. It shook more violently than it has ever shaken since people first lived on earth.
66019010	Faith	I immediately ◄prostrated myself/knelt down► at his feet in order to worship him. But he said to me, “Do not worship me! I am just your (sg) fellow servant and the fellow servant of your (sg) fellow believers who tell people about Jesus. God is the one whom you should worship, because it is the Spirit of God who gives people the power to tell others about Jesus (OR, those who tell others about Jesus are truly declaring the words that the Spirit of God has given them)!”
46002010	Grace	God has caused his Spirit to reveal those things to us (inc) believers. His Spirit can do that because he knows thoroughly the meaning of all things. He even knows the things about God that are very difficult to understand.
50002029	Recommendation	Welcome him very joyfully just like believers in our Lord Jesus should welcome one another. While he was working for Christ, he was helping me in place of you because you were far away. He knew that he might die as a result of helping me, and truly he nearly did die. So honor him, and honor all those who are like him.
51003020	Recommendation	You children, obey your parents in every circumstance, because the Lord God is pleased when you do that.
47001012	Faith	I am happy to say that I have behaved toward all people [MTY] in an honest and sincere way. I am sure within myself that this is true. Especially, I have behaved toward you honestly and sincerely because that is what God wants us to do. As I have done that, my thoughts have not been the thoughts that unbelieving people [MTY] think are wise. Instead, I have behaved toward people only as God wants me to, depending on God to help me in ways that I do not deserve.
43014021	Faith	Those who have accepted my commands and obey them are the people who love me. My Father will love those who love me. I also will love them, and I will fully reveal to them what I am like.”
51002023	Sin	Do not obey such regulations/rules because they only cause people to do what their self-directed nature wants to do. Those regulations seem to be wise because they urge people to worship as mere human teachers have decided. They urge that people should humiliate themselves, and that people should treat their bodies harshly. But those regulations/rules do not help people at all to not do the sinful things that their self-directed nature wants to do.
64001006	Recommendation	Some of them have reported before the congregation here how you have showed that you love them. You should continue to help such people in their travels in a way that is pleasing to God.
55002023	Recommendation	Do not talk with anyone who foolishly wants to argue about matters that are not important. Do not talk with them, because you know that when people talk about foolish things, they begin to quarrel.
47003018	Faith	It is as though God has removed the veil from our faces [MET]. We realize how awesome Jesus is. As we realize that, we are continually being changed { the Holy Spirit is continually changing us} to become more and more like Jesus, so that people can see, more and more, how awesome Jesus is. It is the Spirit of the Lord who does this.
58009014	Grace	So, because we know what Christ accomplished when his blood flowed when he died for us [PRS, MTY], we will be very certain that we are not guilty for having done those things that those who are spiritually dead do. As a result, we can serve the all-powerful God. The priests always offer to God animals with no defects. Similarly, when Christ offered himself as a sacrifice to God, he was sinless [MET]. He did that as a result of God's eternal Spirit helping him.
44011017	Grace	God gave those non-Jews the same Holy Spirit that he had given to us (inc) after we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. So, ◄ I could not possibly tell God that he did wrong when he gave them the Holy Spirit!/how could I tell God that he did wrong when he gave them the Holy Spirit?► [RHQ] He was showing that he had received them!”
49004030	Faith	God has given you his Spirit ◄to confirm/to assure you► that some day God will claim all you people whom Christ has redeemed [MET], just like people confirm that something belongs to them by putting their seal on it. So do not cause God's Holy Spirit to be sad ◄ by the way you talk/by the things that you say►.
66003003	Recommendation	So then, keep remembering God's message, what you accepted when you heard it. Obey it continually, and turn away from your sinful behavior. If you do not become aware of your spiritual need and turn away from your [MET] sinful behavior, I will come to you when you are not expecting me, as a thief comes [SIM]. You will never know at what time I will come to judge you.
62003007	Recommendation	So I urge you, who are all very dear to me, do not let anyone deceive you by telling you that it is all right to sin. If you continue doing what is right, you are righteous, just like Christ is righteous.
62004001	Recommendation	Dear friends, many people who have a false message are teaching it to people [MTY]. So do not trust every message that someone claims/says that God's Spirit [MTY] gave to him. Instead, ◄test/think carefully about► the teachings that you hear in order to know whether they are from God or not.
44013038	Grace	“Therefore, my fellow Israelis and other friends, it is important for you to know that we(exc) are declaring to you that God can forgive you for your sins as a result of what Jesus has done. Because of what Jesus has done, God considers that everyone who believes in Jesus is no longer guilty (OR, the record has been erased { God has erased the record}) concerning everything that they have done that displeased God. But when God does that for you, it is not as a result of your obeying the laws that Moses wrote.
50003001	Recommendation	Now there are other things that I want to write about. My fellow believers, continue to rejoice because you belong to the Lord. Though I will now write to you about those same matters that I mentioned to you before, this is not tiresome for me, and it will protect you from those who would harm you spiritually.
46011034	Recommendation	Those who are so hungry that they cannot wait to eat until everyone else has arrived should eat in their own homes first, in order that when you gather together God will not judge and punish them for ◄ being inconsiderate of/not being concerned about► others. And when I come to Corinth I will give you instructions about other matters concerning the Lord's Supper.
43018031	Description	Then Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your own laws!” Then the Jewish leaders [SYN] said, “ No! We want him executed, but we want you Romans to execute him, because we Jews have no right to execute anyone!”
46012031	Faith	But you should eagerly desire to have the abilities that will help other believers the most (OR, the abilities that God considers to be the most important). But now I will tell you the best way to use the abilities that God's Spirit has given you.
58007026	Description	Jesus is the kind of high priest that we need. He was holy, he did no wrong, and he was innocent. God has now separated him from living among sinners, and has now taken him up to the highest heaven.
50004013	Faith	I am able ◄to cope with/to handle► every situation because Christ gives me the strength to do that.
52004003	Recommendation	God wants you to live pure lives that will show that you completely belong to him. He wants you to avoid doing any sexually immoral acts (OR, avoid being sexually immoral in any way).
51004002	Recommendation	Pray to God persistently, and as you pray be alert and be thanking God.
44007029	Description	When Moses heard that, he thought to himself, ‘Obviously, people know what I have done, and someone will kill me.’ He was afraid, so he fled from Egypt to Midian land. He lived there for some years. He got married, and he and his wife had two sons.”
46011007	Description	Men should not wear coverings over their heads when they pray or speak messages that God gave them, because they represent what God is like [MET] and they show how great God is. But women show how great men (OR, their husbands) are.
51003015	Faith	Because God chose you to live peacefully with one another in your local congregations, let that peace which Christ gives control your ◄inner beings/hearts►, and be constantly thanking God.
58002010	Grace	It was fitting that God make Jesus ◄perfect/all that God intended him to be►. He was enabling many people who would belong to him [MET] to share his glory. God is the one who created all things, and he is the one for whom all things exist. He perfected Jesus by causing him to suffer and die. Jesus is the one who enables God to save people.
59004001	Sin	◄Now I will tell you why you are fighting among yourselves and quarreling with each other./Do you know why you are fighting among yourselves and quarreling with each other?► [RHQ] It is [RHQ] because each of you wants to do the evil things that you ◄ enjoy doing/like to do► [PRS]. You keep on wanting to do things that are opposed to what God wants you to do.
46005001	Sin	Now I want to discuss another matter. It has been {People have} reported to me, and I believe that it is true, that some people among you have been acting in a sexually immoral way, in a way that is so bad that not even ◄pagans/people who do not know about God► act that way. People tell me that a man is living with his stepmother (OR, his father's other wife).
46010013	Faith	Remember that your desires to sin are the same desires that other people have. But when you are tempted to sin, you can trust God to help you. He will not permit you to be tempted {anything to tempt you} more than you are able to resist. Instead, when you are tempted {things tempt you}, he will also provide a way for you to endure it without sinning.
44020029	Violence	I know very well that after I leave, people who teach [MET] false doctrines will come among you and will do great harm to the believers. They will be like fierce wolves that kill the sheep.
53001004	Faith	As a result, we keep proudly telling about you to the other congregations who worship God. Specifically, we tell them that you are being steadfast and that you continue believing in the Lord Jesus, even though you are frequently suffering [DOU] as a result of people causing you trouble.
62004012	Faith	No one has ever seen God. Nevertheless, if we love each other, it is evident that God lives within us and that we love others just like he intends/wants us to do.
48001001	Description	I, Paul, write this letter to you. I remind you that I am an apostle. That is not because a group of people appointed me, nor because a human being sent me to be an apostle. Instead, Jesus Christ and God our heavenly Father, who caused Jesus to become alive again after he died, have appointed and sent me to be an apostle.
58012003	Recommendation	Jesus patiently endured it when sinful people acted so hostilely against him. Compare yourselves with him so that you do not give up trusting God or become discouraged.
45006005	Faith	Because of our close relationship with Christ, we have separated ourselves from the former way in which we conducted our lives, just like he was separated from his physical life when he died [MET]. But God will also certainly enable us to live in a new way, just like he enabled Christ to live again.
45015010	Recommendation	David also wrote, “Rejoice, you non-Jews, with us who are God's people.”
54004001	Sin	God's Spirit has clearly told us that in later times some people will stop believing the teaching that all of us believe. Instead, they will listen to evil spirits who deceive people. They will also believe the false doctrines/teachings that they receive from these evil spirits.
56003001	Recommendation	Remind the believers that they should submit to all those who rule them or have authority over them, and that they should obey them. They should be ready to do anything that is helpful.
61003005	Sin	They will say that because they ◄deliberately overlook the fact/have decided to ignore what they know► that God, by commanding long ago that it should be so, caused the heavens to exist, and he caused the earth to come up out of water and to be separate from the water.
60003018	Grace	I say that because Christ died once for the sake of people who have sinned. He was a righteous person who died for unrighteous people. He died in order that ◄he might bring us to/we might begin an intimate relationship with► God. During the time that he had an ordinary body, he was killed {people killed him}, but God's Spirit caused him to become alive again.
61002021	Sin	Because God will severely punish them, it would have been better for them if they had never known what it means to conduct their lives in a righteous manner. It is too bad that although they knew how to conduct their lives in a righteous manner, they rejected the things that God commanded people to do, the things that were taught to them ◄ by us apostles/by Christ► {that ◄ we apostles/Christ► taught to them}.
53003006	Recommendation	Our fellow believers, we command you, with the authority [MTY] that our Lord Jesus Christ has given to us, that you stop associating with every fellow believer who is lazy and refuses to work. That is, you must stay away from those who are not conducting their lives in the manner that we taught you.
45005012	Sin	What you can learn from what I have written so far is as follows: All people are sinful [PRS], and that is the result of Adam, the first man whom God created, sinning long ago. Adam died [PRS] because he sinned. So, all people who have lived since then die, because it is as though all people sinned when Adam sinned.
58011033	Faith	It was because they trusted God that some of them did great deeds for him. Some conquered lands ruled by powerful men. Some ruled Israel and justly punished those men and nations who rebelled against God. Some obtained from God the things that he promised to give them [MTY].
47004009	Faith	We are frequently persecuted { People frequently cause us to suffer}, but God never leaves us alone. Sometimes we are badly wounded { people badly wound us}, but God does not allow us to be killed { them to kill us}.
59004004	Sin	Like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, you are being unfaithful to God and not obeying him anymore [MET]. Those who are behaving as evil people do [MTY] (OR, Those who love the evil pleasures of this world) are hostile toward God. Perhaps you do not realize that [RHQ]. So those who decide to act as evil people do [MTY] become enemies of God.
44016006	Description	Paul and his companions wanted/planned to enter Asia province and preach the message about Jesus there, but they were prevented by the Holy Spirit {the Holy Spirit prevented them} from going there. So they traveled through Phrygia and Galatia provinces.
45010006	Faith	But those whose record of sins God has erased as a result of their believing in Christ can say to anyone [PRS] as Moses said, “You should not critically say inwardly, ‘◄Someone will have to go up and enter heaven!/Who will go up and enter heaven?►’ [RHQ]” That is to say, someone will have to go up and bring Christ down to bring the message of salvation to us!
66016002	Violence	So the first angel went and poured out on the earth the wine/liquid that was in [MTY] his bowl. As a result, horrible and painful sores broke out on his enemies who had allowed the beast's agents to mark them and who worshipped the image of the beast.
66005008	Description	When he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders ◄prostrated themselves/knelt down► before Jesus, the one who is like a lamb, to worship him. They each had a harp, and they had golden bowls full of incense that represents the prayers of God's people.
62005001	Faith	All those who believe that Jesus is the ◄Messiah/person God sent to rescue us► are ones who have truly become children of God. And everyone who loves a man who is someone's father will be expected to love that man's children as well. Similarly, those who love God, who has caused them to become his children [MET], should love their fellow believers, whom God has also caused to become his children.
48005026	Recommendation	We should not be saying how great we are. We should not be making ourselves more important than others. We should not envy each other.
54005001	Recommendation	Do not rebuke/scold older men. Instead, exhort/advise them respectfully as you would exhort/advise your father. Exhort/advise younger men gently as you would exhort/advise your brothers.
60002012	Recommendation	Keep conducting your lives in a good way among those who do not know God. If you do that, although they may accuse you, saying that you are people who do what is evil, they will see your good behavior, and at the time when God comes to judge people, they will ◄give honor to him/say that what he does is right►.
50003006	Sin	I was so zealous to make people obey those laws that I caused the people who believe in Christ to suffer because I thought they were trying to abolish those laws. Indeed, as far as my obeying those laws is concerned, no one could have accused me by saying that I had disobeyed any of those laws.
43004052	Description	He asked them, “At what time did my son start to become well?” They said to him, “His fever ceased yesterday afternoon at one o'clock.”
43019031	Violence	That was the day that they prepared everything for their ◄ Sabbath/day of rest►. The next day was a special day of rest, because it was the day of rest during the Passover celebration. The Jewish leaders [SYN] did not want the bodies of the three men to remain on the cross during their ◄Sabbath/day of rest► because leaving bodies hanging overnight would be contrary to their Jewish laws. So they went to Pilate and asked him to command that the legs of the three men on the crosses be broken {the soldiers to break the legs of the three men on the crosses}, so that they would die quickly. Then their bodies could be taken down and buried {someone could take down their bodies and bury them}.
43019012	Description	Because of that, Pilate kept trying to release Jesus. But the Jewish leaders [SYN], threatening to report to the Emperor that Pilate was not going to punish a man who claimed he was a king, continued to shout, “Anyone who claims that he is a king is opposing the Emperor! So if you release this man, we will make sure that the Emperor learns about it, and then he will not consider you as his friend!”
43014001	Faith	Jesus continued by saying to us, “Stop being anxious/worried. Keep on trusting in God (OR, You are trusting in God); also keep trusting in me.
50001028	Faith	And I will know that you are not at all frightened by {afraid of} the people who oppose you. This will show/prove to those people that God will destroy them, but this will show/prove to you that God will save you eternally. It is God who is doing all this.
43015016	Grace	You did not decide to become my disciples. Instead, I chose you, so that you would do many things that please him [MET]. The results of what you do will last forever. I also chose you so that my Father will do for you whatever you, using my authority, ask him to do [MTY].
58011004	Faith	It was because Adam's son Abel trusted God that he sacrificed something better to God than what his older brother Cain offered to God. Because Abel did that, when God spoke well about what Abel sacrificed, God declared that Abel was righteous. And although Abel is dead, we still learn from him about trusting God.
46004001	Recommendation	So, people ought to consider us apostles (OR, Apollos and me) to be merely servants of Christ. God has given to us (exc) the work of telling others the message that God has now revealed to us.
66006013	Description	The stars fell to the earth in great numbers, just [SIM] like immature figs fall when a fig tree is shaken by a strong wind {when a strong wind shakes a fig tree}.
46010014	Recommendation	So, I say to you people whom I love, avoid worshipping idols just like you would run away from anything that is dangerous.
45012021	Recommendation	Do not let evil deeds that others have done to you overcome you (sg) by making you do evil to them! [PRS] Instead, overcome their evil deeds by doing good deeds to them.
55002014	Recommendation	Those whom you appointed to teach others God's truth, keep reminding them about these things that I have told you. Tell them strongly that, since God knows what they are doing (OR, that God will judge them for everything that is wrong that they do, and therefore) they must not quarrel ◄about words/about matters that are not important►, because, when teachers quarrel, it helps no one, and because, when they quarrel, they spiritually destroy those who hear them (OR, they cause those who hear them to quit ◄being committed to Christ/believing in Christ►.)
59004008	Recommendation	Come near spiritually to God, and as a result he will come near to you. You who are sinners, stop doing what is wrong and do only what is good [SYN, MET]. You who cannot decide whether you will ◄ commit yourselves to God/obey God completely►, stop thinking wrong thoughts, and think only pure thoughts [MTY].
59002009	Sin	But if you honor some people more than others, you are ◄doing wrong/sinning►. And because you do not do what God commanded us to do, he condemns you [PRS] because you disobey his laws.
52004007	Grace	When God chose us believers, he did not want us to be people who behave in a sexually immoral way. On the contrary, he wants us to be people who behave in a morally pure way.
45001018	Sin	From where God rules in heaven he is making it clear to all non-Jewish people who show no respect for God and who do wicked things, that he is angry with them and that they deserve to be punished { that he would punish them} [MTY]. By means of their behaving wickedly, they keep other people from believing what they know to be true about God.
62004007	Faith	Dear friends, we must love each other, because God enables us to love each other, and because those who love their fellow believers have become God's children and ◄know/have a close relationship with► him.
62002009	Sin	Those who claim that they are pure in every way, like people [MET] living in the light, but hate any of their fellow believers, are still behaving in an impure manner, like [MET] people who are continually living in darkness.
60004014	Grace	If you are insulted {If people insult you} because you believe in Christ [MTY], God is pleased with you, because it shows that the Spirit of God, the Spirit who reveals how great God is, lives within you.
44021019	Grace	Paul greeted them, and then he reported all of the things that God had enabled him to do among the non-Jewish people.
43008046	Sin	Since I have never sinned, ◄none of you can show that I have sinned./can anyone among you show that I have sinned?► [RHQ] So, since I tell you the truth, ◄there is no good reason for your not believing me!/why is it that you do not believe me?► [RHQ]
58010017	Grace	Then he said: I will forgive them for their [DOU] sins, and I will consider that they are no longer guilty for having sinned.
46001005	Grace	That is, God has very abundantly [HYP] helped you spiritually because of your ◄having a close relationship with/being united to► Christ. Specifically, God has abundantly [HYP] enabled you to speak messages that his Spirit revealed to you, and he has abundantly enabled you to know many things [HYP] that his Spirit revealed to you.
45015030	Recommendation	Because we belong to our Lord Jesus Christ and because the Spirit of God causes us to love each other, I urge you all that you help me by fervently/intensely praying to God for me.
43007020	Violence	Someone in the crowd answered, “ By saying this you show that you are crazy (OR, A demon is controlling you)! Certainly no one is trying to kill you!”
45003025	Grace	God showed that Christ was the one who would atone for (OR, forgive) our sins with the blood that flowed from his body when he died. God redeems/forgives us because of our trusting in Christ's having died for us. God wanted to show that he acts justly. He wanted to do that because, before Christ came, God did not punish everyone who sinned. So it seemed as though he was not being just. But he was overlooking their sins during that time,
43018018	Description	It was cold, so the high priest's slaves and Temple guards made a charcoal fire and were standing around it to keep warm. Peter was also standing near it, warming himself.
49006011	Recommendation	Just like a soldier puts on all his ◄armor/things to help him fight► [MET], you should use every spiritual resource/help that God provides for you, in order that you may successfully resist the devil when he cleverly tries to oppose you.
43013037	Faith	Peter said, “Lord, why can I not come with you now? I am ready to die for you!”
50004007	Faith	As a result, God will enable you not to worry about anything [MTY] (OR, God will protect your minds in every way) [PRS]. That is, he will cause you to have inner peace because you have a relationship with Christ Jesus. You will not be able to understand [PRS] how you can be so peaceful in such difficult circumstances!
59003009	Faith	We use our tongue to praise God, who is our Lord and Father, but we also use our same tongue to ask God to do evil to people. That is very wrong, because God made people like himself.
46005010	Sin	I did not mean that you should not associate with unbelievers who are immoral, or who desire things that belong to others, or who ◄forcefully seize things that belong to others/are swindlers►, or who worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid all people like that.
44026009	Sin	“ Formerly I, too, was sure that I should do everything that I could to oppose Jesus [MTY], the man from Nazareth town.
61002014	Sin	They want to commit [MTY] adultery with every woman whom they look at. They never stop seeking opportunities to sin. They entice/persuade those who are spiritually unstable to join them in doing the sinful things that they do. Because of their ever-increasing ◄greed/desire to have more and more things►, they are doomed to eternal punishment.
43010012	Description	A worker whom someone has hired to look after the sheep is not like the shepherd or the one who owns the sheep. So when he sees a wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock of sheep and seizes one sheep and causes the others to scatter.
59001019	Recommendation	My fellow believers whom I love, you know (OR, I want you to now) that every one of you should be eager to pay attention to God's true message. You should not hastily speak your own thoughts, nor be quick to get angry,
46009014	Recommendation	So the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the good message about him should receive from those who hear that message what they need to live on.
43012046	Grace	I have come into the world to show people God's truth, as a light shows people what is around them. I have come in order that people who believe in me will not remain ignorant of God's truth [MET], as those who are in the darkness are ignorant of what is around them.
43005014	Description	Later, Jesus found the man in the Temple courtyard. He told the man his name, and said to him, “Listen! You are healed! So stop sinning! If you do not stop sinning, something will happen to you that will be worse than the illness you had before!”
46016014	Recommendation	Act in a loving way in everything that you do.
43014015	Recommendation	“If you love me, you will do what I have commanded you.
58012025	Recommendation	Beware that you do not refuse to listen to God who is speaking to you. The Israelite people did not escape God punishing them when Moses (OR, God) warned them here on earth. So ◄we shall surely not escape God punishing us if we reject him when he warns us from heaven!/how shall we escape God punishing us if we reject him when he warns us from heaven?► [RHQ]
48004008	Sin	When you did not have a relationship with God [MET], you served gods that really did not exist [MET]. You were their slaves.
44003026	Grace	Peter concluded, “ So when God sent to the earth ◄Jesus, the one who always obeys him/his servant Jesus►, he sent him first to you Israelites to bless you. God will enable you to stop doing what is wicked and to start doing what pleases him.”
44010039	Violence	“We apostles tell people about all the things that we saw Jesus do in Jerusalem and in the rest of Israel. The leaders in Jerusalem had him killed by being nailed to a cross.
46001010	Recommendation	My fellow believers, by the authority of [MTY] our Lord Jesus Christ, I urgently appeal to all of you to agree with one another. What I mean is, stop dividing into groups. Instead, be united [MET] concerning what you understand about spiritual matters and be united in what you decide.
51001021	Sin	As for you, although formerly God considered you his enemies (OR, God considered you as alienated from him) and although you were formerly hostile to God because you thought evil thoughts and because you did evil deeds,
55002022	Recommendation	Because of that, you (sg) must avoid doing the wrong actions that many young people desire to do. Instead, you must earnestly do right actions, believe the true teaching, love God and others, and you must continually be at peace with those who ask the Lord to help them and who are pure in every way (OR, who serve Jesus faithfully).
51003001	Faith	You now are alive spiritually, and it is as though you were raised { God caused you to become alive} when he caused Christ to become alive again. So be constantly wanting what is associated with heaven [MTY], where Christ is. There God has given him supreme authority and the highest honor.
66008007	Violence	When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire mixed with blood poured down onto the earth. As a result, a third of everything on the surface of the land was burned up { the fire burned up a third of everything on the surface of the land}. A third of the trees were also burned up {It also burned up a third of the trees}, and a third of all the green grass was burned up.
66011017	Faith	They said: Lord God, you are the Almighty One! You are the one who exists now! You are the one who has always existed! We thank you that you have defeated with your power everyone who has rebelled against you, and you now rule over all the people in the world.
43004010	Grace	Jesus replied to her, “If you (sg) knew what God wanted to give you, and if you knew who I am, the one who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked me, and I would have given you water that gives life.”
51003004	Grace	When Christ, who causes you to live spiritually, is publicly revealed, then God will also reveal you publicly together with Christ, and you together with Christ will be glorious.
43020031	Faith	But these that I have written about, I have written about them in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►, and in order that you may have eternal life by trusting ◄in him /in what he has done for you► [MTY].
62004006	Faith	As for us (exc), because we belong to God, whoever ◄knows/has a close relationship with► God listens to us. But those who do not belong to God do not listen to us. That is how we can know whether the things that people are teaching [MTY] are true or whether they are false, and deceiving people.
65001012	Description	Those teachers of false doctrine are as dangerous to you as [MET] ◄hidden rocks on a reef/rocks underneath the surface of the ocean► are to a boat. When you gather together to eat the meals that help you believers to love each other more and have a closer relationship with each other, they join you and carouse shamelessly, caring only for themselves and not for others. Because they do not do anything to help others [MET], they are as useless as clouds that are blown along by the wind {that the wind blows along} but that do not produce/give any rain. They are as disappointing as [MET] trees that do not produce fruit in the autumn as we expect them to. They are not only spiritually [MET] dead themselves, but they are not able to cause others to be alive spiritually, just like [MET] trees that have been {that someone has} uprooted and as a result are unable to produce any fruit.
44005015	Description	The apostles were doing amazing miracles, so people were bringing those who were sick into the streets and laying them on stretchers and mats, in order that when Peter came by he would touch them, or at least his shadow might come upon some of them and heal them.
49006016	Faith	In addition, keep trusting firmly in the Lord. That will enable you to protect yourselves from anything that Satan, the evil one, may do to harm you spiritually, just like soldiers carry shields to protect themselves against the arrows that have flaming tips that their enemies shoot at them [MET].
51003023	Recommendation	Whatever work you do, work wholeheartedly. Work wholeheartedly, like those who are working for the Lord Jesus. Do not work like those who are working merely for their masters,
58012016	Recommendation	Do not let anyone be immoral, or be irreligious as Esau was. He exchanged the rights he had as a firstborn son for only one meal.
43018040	Sin	They shouted again, “No, do not release this man! Instead, release Barrabas!” But Barrabas was in prison because he was a revolutionist!
55003004	Sin	They will ◄betray others/hand others over to their enemies► and act foolishly. They will be overly/very proud of themselves, and they will love to please themselves instead of loving God.
50002009	Grace	As a result, God raised him to a rank that is above every other rank.
61001016	Description	We apostles told you that our Lord Jesus Christ acts powerfully and that he is coming back some day. We were not basing what we told you on stories that we had cleverly ◄invented/made up►. Instead, we told you what we ourselves saw with our own eyes, that the Lord Jesus is supremely great.
61003016	Sin	In the letters that Paul wrote there are certain things that are difficult for people to understand. People who are spiritually ignorant and ◄unstable/do not believe firmly in Christ► interpret these things wrongly, as they also ◄interpret/explain the meaning of► the other parts of the Scriptures wrongly. The result is that they will destroy themselves spiritually, and God will punish them.
44014014	Description	But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard about that, and understood that the people thought that they were gods and wanted to sacrifice the bulls to worship them, they were very distressed, so they tore their own clothes. They rushed among the people, shouting,
45015008	Faith	I want you to remember that Christ helped us Jews [MTY] by what he did, in order to show that God ◄is faithful/does what he says he will do►. That is, his coming as our Messiah fulfilled what God promised to our Jewish ancestors.
59001026	Sin	Some people think that they worship God rightly, but they habitually speak evil talk [MTY]. Those people are wrong in thinking [SYN] that they worship God rightly. The fact is that they worship God ◄in vain/uselessly►.
43015020	Recommendation	Remember these words that I told you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ That means that you, who are like my servants, cannot expect people to treat you better than they treat me. So, since they have ◄persecuted me/caused me to suffer►, they will ◄persecute you/cause you to suffer► also. If they had paid attention to the things I taught them, they would pay attention to what you teach them.
43008031	Faith	Then Jesus said to the Jews who now said they believed in him, “If you continue to live in accordance with my message, you will truly be my disciples.
44007011	Description	“ While Joseph was doing that work, there was a time ◄when there was very little food/of famine► throughout Egypt and also throughout Canaan. People did not have enough food to eat. People were suffering. At that time Jacob and his sons in Canaan also could not find enough food.
63001004	Faith	I am very happy because I learned about some of you [SYN] who are conducting your lives in a manner that is ◄consistent/in accordance► with God's true message. You are doing that just like our Father God commanded us to do.
54005008	Faith	If anyone does not take care of those who live in his own house, and especially if he does not take care of his own family, he has ◄denied/quit believing► what we believe and we should consider that he is worse than a person who does not believe in Christ.
58010022	Faith	Just like the priests were sprinkled { as Moses sprinkled the priests} with blood [MET] to symbolize that they were no longer guilty for having sinned, we also no longer are guilty for having done evil. Just like the priests ceremonially washed their bodies with pure water to prepare themselves to serve God, we are allowing God to continually make us pure. So, we (inc) must approach God sincerely by confidently trusting in him.
48001023	Description	They only heard others say about me repeatedly, “ Paul, the one who was formerly doing harmful things to us, is now telling the same message which we believe and which formerly he was trying ◄to destroy/to cause people to stop believing►!”
44027034	Recommendation	So, now I urge you to eat some food. We (inc) need to do that in order to stay alive. I tell you to do that because I know that none of you will drown [IDM].”
66002003	Faith	I know also that you continue to serve me steadfastly. Even when people ◄ caused you to suffer/persecuted you►, you continued to serve me because you believe in me, and you have not become too tired to keep on serving me.
56002002	Recommendation	Specifically, tell the older men that they should control themselves ◄in all situations/whatever happens►, that they should behave in such a manner that all people will respect them, and that they should control what they say and do. And tell them that they should firmly believe in the correct teachings, that they should sincerely love others, and that they should always be steadfast.
44017030	Recommendation	During the times when people did not know what God wanted them to do, he did not immediately punish them for what they did. But now God commands all people everywhere to turn away from their evil behavior.
43019025	Description	Near the cross where they had nailed Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and another Mary, the woman from Magdala village.
66019013	Description	The cloak he was wearing was drenched with blood. His name is also “◄The one who expresses what God is like/The Word of God►.”
46008009	Recommendation	However, be sure that you do not do anything that God allows you to do, if by doing that you would encourage any of your fellow believers to do something that they are not sure God allows them to do. As a result, you would be causing them to sin.
44013034	Grace	God has ◄raised the Messiah from the dead/caused the Messiah to live again after he had died► and will never let him die again. Concerning that, God said to our Jewish ancestors, ‘I will surely help you, as I promised David that I would do.’
43014020	Faith	At that time you will know that I have a close relationship with my Father, and you will have a close relationship with me, and I will have a close relationship with you.
62002003	Faith	I will tell you how we can be sure that we ◄know/have a close relationship with► God. If we obey what he commands us to do, that shows us that we have a close relationship with him. So we must always obey what he commands us to do.
43008024	Sin	I told you that you will die without God forgiving your sins. If you do not believe that I am who I say that I am, you will die without God forgiving your sins.”
66017006	Sin	I saw that the woman had become drunk as a result of drinking the blood of God's people, those who had told others about Jesus. When I saw her, I was very bewildered/perplexed.
58012017	Description	You know that after he did that, he wanted to receive what his father would promise to give him if he blessed him. But his father refused to do what he requested. And Esau found no way to change what he had done, even though he sought tearfully to do that.
43007012	Description	Among the crowds, many people were whispering about Jesus. Some were saying, “He is a good man!” But others were saying instead, “No! He is deceiving the crowds!”
44011021	Faith	The Lord God [MTY] was powerfully enabling those believers to preach effectively. As a result, very many non-Jewish people believed their message and trusted in the Lord Jesus.
52002004	Faith	On the contrary, we tell God's message because he trusted us to do that, because he examined us and considered us to be acceptable to tell people the message about Christ. As we teach people, we do not say what they like to hear. Instead, we say what God wants us to say, because he examines everything that we think and what we desire.
46015057	Grace	But because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done, he enables us to be free from having to obey God's laws to be saved and to be free of being afraid to die. We should thank God for that!
54005005	Faith	The widows who are really alone and have no one to help them confidently expect that God will help them. So night and day they pray, earnestly asking [DOU] God that he will help them and others.
43016024	Grace	Up to the present time, using my authority you have not asked God to do anything for you [MTY]. Now keep asking him for things that you need. If you do that, you will receive them, and then you will be completely joyful.
46007021	Recommendation	If one of you was a slave when you (sg) became a Christian [RHQ], do not be concerned about it. However, if you get an opportunity to be free, do what you need to do to become free
65001019	Sin	That describes the teachers of false doctrine well, because they are the ones who cause believers to divide among themselves. They do what their own minds tell them to do. The Spirit of God does not live within them.
48001006	Sin	I am very disappointed [IRO] that so soon after you trusted in Christ you have turned away from God. He chose you in order that you might have what Christ freely/kindly gives. I am also disappointed that so soon you are believing a different message which some say is “good news.”
58012014	Recommendation	Try to live peacefully with all people. Seek to be holy, since no one will see the Lord if he is not holy.
43021006	Description	He said to us, “Throw your net out from the right-hand side of the boat! Then you will find some!” We did that, and we caught so many fish in the net that we were unable to pull the net into the boat
46007019	Recommendation	You should not try to change your status that way, because it means nothing to God whether someone is circumcised or not. What is important is that we obey what God has commanded.
45012008	Recommendation	Those whom God has enabled to encourage/exhort his people should do that. Those who share their goods/money with others should do it sincerely/generously. Those who govern ◄ the congregation/others► should do it wholeheartedly. Those who help the needy should do it cheerfully.
44019002	Faith	He asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed God's message?” They answered, “No, we (exc) did not. We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
53003014	Recommendation	If any fellow believer refuses to work and does not obey what I have written in this letter, ◄ publicly identify that person/tell the congregation what that person is doing►. Then do not associate with him, in order that he may become ashamed.
46015050	Sin	My fellow believers, I want you to know that we (inc) [SYN] cannot go to heaven, where God rules over everything, with our physical bodies, because our bodies cannot last forever. They will die and decay.
43006027	Recommendation	Stop desiring food that will soon spoil! Instead, desire to get spiritual food that will last forever! Yearn for eternal life! That is what I, the one who came from heaven, will give you. God my Father has shown that he approves of me doing that.”
59004003	Sin	And even when you do ask him, he does not give you what you ask for because you are asking for the wrong reason. You are asking for things in order that you may use them just to ◄enjoy yourselves/make yourselves happy►.
49005020	Faith	At all times thank God, who is our heavenly Father, for everything, because of what the Lord Jesus Christ [MTY] has done for you.
48003006	Faith	What you have experienced is as Moses wrote in the Scriptures about Abraham. He wrote that Abraham trusted God, and as a result, he was considered as being righteous { God erased the record of his sins}.
66021023	Grace	The city will not need the sun or the moon to light the city, because the glory of God will light the city, and Jesus, the one who is like a lamb, will also be its light.
45008009	Faith	But we do not have to let our self-directed nature control us. Instead, we can let God's Spirit control us, because he lives within us. If people do not have living in them the Spirit who comes from Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
45011023	Faith	And if the Jews believe in Christ [LIT], God also will reunite them to himself as branches are grafted { as people graft branches} into a tree again, because God is able to do that.
66014005	Description	Those people never lie when they speak [MTY], and they never act immorally.
44024014	Faith	But I admit to you (sg) that this is true: I do worship the God that our ancestors worshipped. It is true that I follow the way that Jesus taught us. The Jewish leaders call that a false religion/teaching. I also believe everything that was written by Moses {that Moses wrote} in the laws that God gave him and everything that was written by the other prophets {that the other prophets wrote} in their books [MTY].
45013008	Recommendation	Pay all of your debts when you are supposed to pay them. The only thing that is like a debt that you should never stop paying is to love one another. Whoever loves others has fulfilled all that God requires in his laws.
66016009	Sin	Because people were severely burned by the intense heat {the intense heat severely burned people}, they said evil things about God [MTY], because he had the power to strike people with plagues like those. But they refused to turn away from their evil behavior and refused to honor him.
66021012	Description	Around the city was a very high wall. The wall had twelve gates. An angel was at each gate. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written { God had written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel} over the gates. Each gate had the name of one tribe.
48003013	Grace	Even though we humans have not continuously and completely obeyed God's laws, Christ rescued us from God punishing us eternally. Christ rescued us by his being the one God condemned instead of God condemning us. What is written { someone/Moses wrote} in the Scriptures shows that this is true. It is written { He wrote}, “ God has cursed anyone whom people have executed for his crimes and whose body they have hung on a tree.”
48001013	Sin	People have told you how I used to behave when I practiced the Jewish religion. They told you that I continually did very harmful things to the groups of believers that God established, and they told you that I tried to get rid of those people.
66020002	Description	He seized the dragon. That dragon is the ancient serpent, the devil, that is, Satan. The angel bound him with the chain. That chain could not be loosed { No one could loose that chain} for a thousand years.
44008009	Description	There was a man in that city whose name was Simon. He had been practicing sorcery for a long time and he had been amazing the people in Samaria province by doing that. He continually claimed that he was a great/important person.
50003010	Faith	I want to know Christ better and better. Particularly, I want to continually experience his working powerfully in ◄me/my life►, just like God worked powerfully when he caused Christ to become alive after he died. I also want to be continually willing to suffer in order that I may obey God, just like Christ suffered in order that he might obey God. I also want to be completely willing to die for Christ, even as he died for me,
54005022	Recommendation	Do not be in a hurry to put your hands on a man ◄ to set him apart/to appoint him► as an elder. Wait until you have examined him to see how he conducts his life, because God will consider that you are responsible if you approve a person who sins, saying that he should become an elder. Keep your life pure in every way.
56002003	Recommendation	Similarly, tell the older women that they should behave ◄in a reverent manner that shows that they are devoted to God/in a manner that honors God►; specifically, they should not ◄slander others/talk evil about others►, and they should not ◄be drinking much. /habitually drinking► alcohol. Tell them that they should teach the younger women what is good,
46007038	Recommendation	So any man who decides that his daughter should get married is doing what is good, but if he decides that she should not get married, he is doing something even better. (OR, Some of you men have asked about the women to whom you are engaged to marry. If any man thinks that he may be treating that woman unfairly by not marrying her, and if it is already past the right time for her to get married, and if he wants to marry her very much, he should do what he wants to do. He should marry her. He will not be sinning by doing that. But if a man feels absolutely sure that it is better for him not to get married, and if nothing is forcing them to get married, if he is free to make his own decision on the matter, if he decides not to get married, he is doing what is right. So any man who decides that he should get married to the woman he is engaged to is doing what is good, but if he decides that he should not get married, he is doing something even better.)
59001022	Recommendation	Do what God commands in his message. Do not only listen to it, because people who only listen to it and do not obey it think wrongly that God will save them.
43007001	Violence	After those things happened, Jesus went around in Galilee province. He did not want to travel in Judea province, because he knew that the Jewish leaders there were wanting to kill him.
46001030	Grace	It is because of what God has done that you ◄have a close relationship with/belong to► Christ Jesus. God accomplished his wise plan to save us by what Christ did for us. As a result of what Christ did, God erases the record of our sins, sets us apart for himself, and frees us from our being guilty for our sins.
43013005	Description	Then he poured some water in a basin. He began to wash our feet, and then dry them with the towel that he had wrapped around himself.
44022004	Violence	That is why I previously persecuted those who believe the message that people call the Way that Jesus taught. I continually looked for ways to kill them. Whenever I found men or women who believed that message, I commanded that they should be seized and thrown { people to seize them and throw them} into jail.
43007043	Description	So the people were divided because of what they thought about Jesus.
60005002	Recommendation	I appeal to you elders to take care of the people who are in your congregations [MET] as shepherds take care of their flocks of sheep. Do this, not because you must do it, but instead do it willingly, as God desires. Do not be greedy to get a lot of money for doing it, but instead do it enthusiastically/wholeheartedly.
46015056	Sin	It is because we sin [MET] that we die, and it is because we have God's laws that we know that we have sinned.
59005004	Sin	Think about what you have done. You have not paid wages to the workmen who have harvested your fields for you, with the result that [PRS] those reapers are crying out to God for him to help them. And God, the all-powerful Lord, has heard their loud cries.
60002001	Recommendation	Therefore, do not act maliciously in any way or deceive others. Do not ◄be a hypocrite/try to make others think that you have qualities that you do not really have►, and do not ◄envy/be jealous of► others. Do not ever slander anyone.
46007039	Recommendation	Women must remain married to their husbands while their husbands are still alive. But if a woman's husband dies, she is free to marry any unmarried man whom she wants to marry, but he must belong to the Lord.
55002018	Sin	Specifically, they teach a wrong message; that is, they say wrongly that God will not raise the dead people because he has already given us spiritual life. They claim that our spiritual life is the only new life that we will receive. By saying that, they cause some people
48005006	Faith	As for us who have a relationship with Christ Jesus, God is not concerned whether we are circumcised or not circumcised. Instead, God is concerned about whether we trust in Christ, with the result that we love other people.
58005009	Grace	By becoming ◄all that God intended him to be/perfect►, he has now become fully qualified to be our high priest. As a result, he is the one who saves eternally all who obey him.
46016001	Recommendation	Now I will reply to another question that you asked. You asked about the money you are collecting to send to God's people in Jerusalem. Do what I told the congregations in Galatia to do.
49005022	Recommendation	Because husbands have authority over [MET] their wives, just as all of us believers form one group under the authority of Christ, you women should submit yourselves to the authority of your husbands just as you submit yourselves to the Lord Jesus. He is the one who saves all his people from the guilt of their sins.
43008012	Faith	Jesus spoke to the people again. He said, “I am like a light [MET] for all the people in [MTY] the world. Just like a light reveals what has been in the darkness [MET], I reveal God's truth to them. Those who walk in the darkness are unaware of what is around them. But those who become my disciples will always be aware of God's truth [MET]. They will have my light which shows them how to have eternal life.”
65001017	Recommendation	But you people whom I love need to remember the things that were predicted by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ {that the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said would happen}.
44017025	Grace	He does not need to have anything made for him by people [MTY] {to have people [MTY] make [MTY] anything for him}, because everything that exists belongs to him. He is the one who causes ◄us (inc)/all people► to live and breathe, and he gives us all the things that we(inc) need.
62005009	Faith	We usually believe what other people say. But what God says is more reliable/trustworthy than what people say. So we must believe what God has said is true about ◄his Son/the one who is also God►.
45013014	Faith	On the contrary, you/we should be like the Lord Jesus Christ so that others will see what he is like, just as people put on special clothes so that others will see what group they belong to [MET]. You/We should stop thinking about doing the things that your/our self-directed nature desires.
58011030	Description	It was because the Israelite people trusted God that the walls around Jericho city collapsed, after the Israelites marched around the walls for seven days.
44019011	Grace	Also, God gave Paul the power [MTY] to do amazing miracles.
43008034	Sin	Jesus replied, “Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. All those who continue to sin are forced to obey their sinful desires [MET], just like a slave is forced to obey his master.
62004011	Faith	Dear friends, since God loves us like that, we certainly ought to love each other!
44002028	Grace	You have told me that you will cause my body to become alive again. You will make me very happy because you will be with me forever.”
54004013	Recommendation	Until I come, be sure that you read the Scriptures to the congregation and that you exhort/urge them to obey the Scriptures, and teach them.
47004008	Description	We are continually oppressed { People continually oppress us} in many ways, but we have not been prevented { God has not allowed them to prevent us} from teaching the message about Jesus Christ. We often do not know what to do in difficult situations, but we never say, “God has abandoned us.”
44002013	Description	But some of them ◄made fun of/laughed at► those who believed in Jesus. They said, “ These people are talking like this because they have drunk too much new wine!”
66021018	Description	The city wall was made of something like the green stone that we call jasper. The city itself was made of something like pure gold that looked like clear glass.
66015006	Description	The seven angels who had the bowls containing the seven plagues came out of the temple. The angels were dressed in clean, white linen garments, and they wore gold bands around their chests.
45012014	Recommendation	Ask God to be kind to those who ◄persecute you/cause you to suffer► because you believe in Jesus! Ask him to be kind to them; do not ask him to cause bad things to happen to them.
66001015	Description	His feet looked like brass that glows as it is being purified {as people purify it} in a furnace. When he spoke, his voice sounded like the sound made by a huge waterfall (OR, a great/wide river of rushing water).
43017026	Grace	I have revealed to them what you are like, and I will continue to reveal to them what you are like. I will do that in order that they may love others just like you love me, and in order that I may be in them by my Spirit.”
45008032	Grace	God did not spare even his very own Son. Instead, he turned him over to others to cruelly kill him in order that all we who believe in him may benefit from his dying for us. Therefore, because God did that, ◄he will also certainly give us freely everything that we need to live for him, in addition to giving us Christ./will he not also certainly give us freely everything that we need to live for him, in addition to giving us Christ?► [RHQ]
65001018	Sin	They told you, “In the final period of time in which we are now living there will be people who will laugh at the truths that God has revealed. They will do the ◄ungodly things/things that are displeasing to God► that their bodies desire.”
45011018	Recommendation	However, you non-Jews must not despise the Jews whom God rejected [MET], who are like the branches that were broken off from the tree If any of you wants to boast about having received blessings from God, remember this: Branches do not nourish a root. Instead the root nourishes the branches [MET]. Similarly, you are blessed by God because of what you have received from the Jews! It is not what the Jews have received from you that blesses them [MET]!
47001024	Faith	It is not that Silas, Timothy and I want to boss you and tell you that you must believe only what we say. Not at all! On the contrary, we (exc) are working as partners with you in order to make you happy. We do not try to force you to believe everything that we believe, because we are sure that you are continuing to trust the Lord Jesus Christ and that you are remaining firmly committed to him.
43011001	Description	One time there was a man whose name was Lazarus who was very sick. He lived in Bethany village, where his older sisters Mary and Martha also lived.
52004008	Sin	So I warn you that those who disregard this teaching of mine are not just disregarding a human being. On the contrary, they are disregarding God, because God commanded it. Remember that God sent his Spirit, who is holy, to live in you!
62004002	Faith	I will tell you how to recognize teachings that come from the Spirit of God: Those who affirm/say that Jesus Christ came from God to become a human like us are teaching a message that is from God.
65001008	Sin	Similarly, these ungodly people in your midst also defile their own bodies by living immorally, because they claim/say that God revealed in visions that they should act that way. They refuse to allow anyone to have authority over them, and they ◄revile/speak evil about► God's glorious/wonderful angels.
60003011	Recommendation	They must continually turn away from doing evil, and must do what is good instead. They must deeply desire to enable people to act peacefully toward each other; they must zealously urge people to act in a peaceful way,
51001023	Faith	But he wants you to continue [DOU] to believe the message about Christ; specifically, he wants you to continue to be stable/steadfast and to continue to confidently expect to receive that which you heard about when you heard that message. That message has been proclaimed {They have proclaimed that message} to people in very many places [HYP]; and I, Paul, have also become one who tells it to people.
43008059	Violence	So, because they were very angry about Jesus thus saying that he ◄ had eternally existed/was equal with God►, they picked up stones to throw at him to kill him. But Jesus caused them not to be able to see him, and he left the Temple courtyard.
49004024	Recommendation	and that you must start being [MET] the new persons that God made you to become. That is, your behavior must be righteous and truly/genuinely devout.
66014012	Faith	So God's people, those who obey what God commands and who trust in Jesus, must faithfully continue obeying and trusting him.
44013030	Description	However, God ◄raised him from the dead/caused him to live again after he had died►
43010011	Description	I am like a good shepherd. A good shepherd is willing to die to save the sheep [MET]. Similarly, I am ready to sacrifice myself to save those who belong to me.
49003002	Grace	I ◄assume that/think that probably► someone has told you how God acted very kindly toward me, appointing me so that I would proclaim the good message to you non-Jews.
56003010	Recommendation	Those people, by teaching things that are false, are causing others ◄to turn away from/to quit believing► the true teachings. You must warn them that God will judge them if they continue doing that. If they do not stop, warn them one more time. If they still do not stop, then no longer allow them to influence the believers.
43010019	Description	After hearing these words that Jesus said, the Jews were divided again.
43003033	Faith	Those who have accepted what he has said verify that what God has said is true.
61003014	Recommendation	Therefore, dear friends, because you are waiting for these things to happen, do all that you can to conduct your lives ◄in a godly manner/in a manner that pleases God►, in order that Christ will see that you are completely pure [DOU] and that you are living peacefully with each other.
53003001	Faith	As for the other matters, our fellow believers, pray for us that more and more people will hear [PRS] our message about our Lord Jesus. Pray that they will believe this message, as you have done.
47004014	Faith	We do this because we (exc) know that although people might kill us, God, who caused the Lord Jesus to live again after he died, will also cause us (exc) to live again after we die. God will do this because we belong to Jesus. And then God will bring us (exc), together with you, to be with him.
59005014	Recommendation	Whoever among you is sick [RHQ] should call the leaders of the congregation to come to pray for him. They should put olive oil on him and, with the Lord's authority [MTY] (OR, calling on the Lord to heal him), pray.
44007023	Description	“ One day when Moses was about forty years old, he decided that he would go and see his fellow Israelites. So he went to the place where they worked.
44023027	Violence	I have sent you(sg) this man, Paul, because certain Jews seized him and were about to kill him. But I heard someone tell me that he is a Roman citizen, so I and my soldiers went and rescued him.
44019029	Description	Many of the other people in the city heard the shouting and went and joined the crowd. They also became angry at Paul and began shouting. Several of the people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, two men from Macedonia who had been traveling with Paul. Then the whole crowd of people ran, dragging those men along with them, to the city stadium.
44003014	Sin	Although Jesus always did what was right/just and good, you rejected him. Pilate wanted to release him, but you urgently asked Pilate to release ◄a murderer/someone who had killed people►!
44015009	Faith	God saved us Jews and those non-Jews similarly, making them clean spiritually simply as a result of their believing in the Lord Jesus. That was exactly how he has forgiven us.
46011028	Recommendation	Before any believer eats that bread and drinks that wine [MTY], he should think carefully about what he is doing,
46015058	Faith	So, my fellow believers whom I love, continue to hold strongly to the things that you believe. Do not let anything cause you to doubt them. Always be doing enthusiastically the work that the Lord gives you. And remember that the work that you do for the Lord is never ◄in vain/useless►, as it would be if God will not cause us to live again after we die.
46004016	Recommendation	So I urge you to live for Christ the way I do.
46001021	Faith	God, acting very wisely, made it impossible for unbelievers to know God by doing what they thought was [IRO] wise. Instead, he was happy to save those who trust in Christ as the result of their hearing the message that was proclaimed to them, a message that others consider to be foolish.
60003001	Recommendation	You women believers, just like slaves should submit themselves to their masters, submit yourselves to your husbands. Do that in order that if any of them do not believe the message about Christ, they may become believers without it being necessary for you to say anything to them about their relationship to God.
47005020	Recommendation	So, it is I and my companions who are Christ's representatives in this world. When we tell people the message about Christ, it is God himself who is pleading with them by means of what we say. So, as true representatives of Christ, we plead with you: Believe God's true message about Christ in order that you may be reconciled to {have a peaceful relationship with} him.
44002024	Description	He suffered terribly when he died, but God caused him to become alive again. God did not let him continue to be dead, because it was not possible for him [PRS] to remain dead.”
59002007	Sin	◄And they are the ones who speak evil against Jesus Christ, the one who is worthy of praise, to whom you belong!/Are they not the ones who speak evil against Jesus Christ, the one who is worthy of praise, to whom you belong?► [RHQ]
54003003	Description	He must not be a drunkard. He must not be ready/quick to fight those who make him angry. On the contrary, he must be gentle and he must not be quarrelsome. He must not be greedy for much money.
43004014	Grace	But those who drink the water that I will give them will never be thirsty again. On the contrary, the water that I give them will become in their inner beings like a spring of water that will enable them to have eternal life.”
62002005	Faith	But those who obey what God commands them to do are the people who love God in the manner in which he wants us to. I will tell you how we can be sure that we have a close relationship with God:
66016013	Description	I saw evil spirits that looked like frogs. One came out of the mouth of the dragon, one from the mouth of the beast, and one from the mouth of the false prophet.
59002008	Recommendation	God has commanded you in the Scriptures that each of you must love other people like you love yourself. That commandment was also given by Jesus our King [MTY]. If you are loving others, you are doing what is right.
47004005	Faith	That is why, when we(exc) teach people, we do not boast about ourselves, as some people say that we do. Instead, we teach you that Jesus Christ is our Lord. We ourselves are only your servants. We want to honor and obey Jesus.
46015033	Recommendation	Do not let yourselves be deceived by those who say that God will not cause believers to live again {Do not let people who say that God will not cause believers to live again deceive you}. If you associate with evil people who say such things, they will ◄influence you to do evil things/destroy your good moral way of living►.
58013020	Grace	Jesus provides for us, protects us, and guides us as a great shepherd does for his sheep [MET]. And God, who gives us inner peace, raised our Lord Jesus from the dead. By doing that, God ratified his eternal covenant with us by the blood that flowed from Christ when he died on the cross.
50001027	Recommendation	Most importantly, as fellow believers in Christ, conduct yourselves just like you learned you should do when you heard the message about Christ. Do that in order that whether I come and see you, or whether I am away from you and people tell me about you, what I hear or see will make me happy. They will tell me that you are unitedly and cooperatively resisting those who oppose the message about Christ (OR, oppose you). I will know that you are not allowing others to influence you to believe a message that is different from the good message about Christ.
46006014	Grace	God, by his power, caused the Lord Jesus to live again after he died, and he will cause us to live again after we die, which shows that he is very concerned about our bodies.
55001006	Recommendation	Because I am sure that you believe in him, I remind you to do fervently/wholeheartedly [MET] what God has ◄assigned for/appointed► you to do and what he has enabled you to do. God ◄ assigned for/appointed► you to do it as a result of my putting my hands on you to show/indicate that he had chosen you to do his work.
60004006	Grace	That is the reason why the message about Christ was preached { people preached the message about Christ} to believers who have now died. That message was preached to them in order that even though sinful people might judge them and say that they are guilty, God's Spirit would enable them to live eternally.
46007023	Recommendation	Christ paid a price to buy you when he died for you. So do not act as if you are evil people's slaves by doing the evil things that they tell you to do.
46010010	Recommendation	We should not complain about what God does. Some of them did that, and as a result an angel destroyed them. So God will certainly punish us if we sin like they did.
47002017	Faith	But perhaps God considers us(exc) sufficient, because we do not work/act like so many others whom you know. They teach God's message in a way that they think people will like, and they think that people will pay them for teaching that way. We (exc) certainly do not do that. On the contrary, as servants of Christ, and knowing that God is watching us (exc), we teach sincerely the message that God sent us to proclaim.
45015001	Recommendation	Most of us are sure that God will not punish us for doing certain things that the laws and rituals God gave Moses said the Jews should not do. But we should be patient with those who are uncertain about such things, and we should not let them irritate us. We should not simply please ourselves.
50002024	Faith	And I am confident that I will soon be released { the authorities will soon release me} so that the Lord will enable me also to come/go to you soon.
66007001	Description	After this I saw four angels. One was standing at the north, one at the east, one at the south, and one at the west. They were restraining the winds that blew from all directions [MTY] to keep them from blowing destructively on the earth or on the ocean or even on any tree.
60004003	Sin	I say that to you because [SAR] you have already spent too much of your time here on earth doing what the people who do not know God like to do. In the past you committed all kinds of sexually immoral acts [DOU], you got drunk and then participated in ◄orgies/wild parties► and carousing/revelry, and you worshipped idols, which is very displeasing to God.
66011005	Violence	If enemies try to harm those witnesses, fire will come from the mouths of the witnesses and destroy them. If people want to harm them, the two witnesses will certainly kill them similarly.
44023005	Recommendation	Paul replied, “My fellow Jews, I am sorry that I said that. I did not know that the man who told one of you to hit me is the high priest. If I had known that, I would not have insulted our high priest, because I know that it is written { that Moses wrote} in our Jewish law, ‘Do not speak evil of any of your rulers!’ ”
66022015	Sin	Outside are people who are unholy. They include people who practice sorcery, people who sin sexually, murderers, idol worshipers, and all people who enjoy telling lies and are continual liars. They can never enter that city.”
66002014	Sin	Nevertheless, I have this complaint against you: You permit some of your members to teach things like Balaam taught long ago. He taught Balak to persuade the Israelite people to sin. Specifically, he taught them to eat food that had been offered to idols, and to practice sexual immorality.
53001003	Faith	Our fellow believers, we thank God very frequently [HYP] for you because we believers ought to thank God for each other, and specifically it is appropriate/right that we should thank God for you. We thank him that you are trusting in the Lord Jesus more and more, and that each one of you is loving each of the others more and more.
46012002	Sin	You know that before you became Christians, various things led you to worship idols, which are unable to tell you any of God's message.
49005025	Recommendation	Each of you husbands, love your wife as Christ loved all of us who would become believers, with the result that he willingly died for our sake,
45012017	Recommendation	Do not do evil deeds to anyone who has done evil to you. Act in a way that all people will recognize as good!
60005006	Recommendation	Therefore, realizing that God has great power [MTY] to punish proud people, humble yourselves in order that he may honor you at the time that he has determined.
44014017	Grace	But he has shown us [LIT] that he acts kindly toward us(inc). He is the one who causes it to rain and causes crops to grow. He is the one who gives you plenty of food, and makes you very happy.”
54003011	Recommendation	Their wives (OR, The women who are deacons) likewise must conduct themselves suitably/appropriately. Specifically, they must be ◄serious/worthy that people respect them►. They must not speak evil about people. They must not drink much alcohol. They must be faithful in everything that they do.
66002021	Sin	Although I gave her time to turn away from her sexual immorality and pagan practices, she did not want to stop doing them.
44012020	Description	King Herod had been furiously angry with the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon cities. Then one day some men who represented them came unitedly to Caesarea in order to meet with Herod. They persuaded Blastus, who was one of Herod's important officials, to tell Herod that the people in their cities wanted to make peace with him. They wanted to be able to trade with the people that Herod ruled, because they needed to buy food from those regions. Herod had commanded the people in the areas he ruled to stop selling food to the people in those cities.
43008049	Sin	Jesus replied, “A demon does not control me! I honor my Father, and you do not honor me!
43006018	Description	A strong wind started to blow and caused the water ◄to become very rough/to have high waves►.
45008018	Faith	I consider that what we suffer during the present time is not worth paying attention to, because the future splendor/glory that will be revealed {that God will reveal} to us is so great.
62002012	Grace	I am writing this to you whom I love as though [MET] you were my little children, to you who are spiritually mature people who are like [MET] fathers, and to you spiritually vigorous/strong people who are like [MET] young men. Remember that your sins have been forgiven { God has forgiven your sins} on account of what Christ [MTY] has done. You now know Christ, the one who always existed. You have defeated the evil one, Satan.
55001009	Grace	God saved us and chose us to conduct our lives in a pure way. It was not our doing good deeds/actions that caused him to do this for us—something that we did not deserve. Instead, before ◄time began/he created the world► he purposed/planned to be kind to us as a result of what Christ Jesus would do for us.
43019006	Violence	When the chief priests and Temple guards saw him, they shouted, “Command your soldiers to kill him by nailing him to a cross! Crucify him!” Pilate, knowing that they could not legally do it themselves, said to them, “You yourselves take him and nail him to a cross! As for me, I do not find that he has done anything for which we should punish him.”
60001010	Grace	As for those who long ago spoke messages that God had revealed to them about how God would act kindly toward you in ways which you did not deserve, they ◄investigated very carefully/tried very hard to learn► [DOU] about how God would save you.
63001007	Sin	Many people who deceive others have left your congregation and have now gone out among other people who are in your area [MTY]. They are the ones who ◄do not acknowledge/refuse to say► that Jesus Christ became human. They are the very ones who deceive people and oppose what we teach about Christ.
44024005	Sin	We (exc) have observed that this man, wherever he goes, causes trouble. Specifically, he causes all the Jews everywhere [HYP] to riot. Also, he leads the entire group whom people call ‘the followers of the Nazarene’, a false sect.
54003016	Grace	It is certainly true that the message that God has now revealed is very wonderful! From it, we learn this spiritual truth that we say/sing about Christ (OR, We affirm this teaching to be true and very important.) It is what shows us how to live ◄in a godly manner/in a manner that pleases God►. It is what God has now revealed, even though it was not known before. We ◄ affirm/say that it is true► concerning Jesus Christ that, He is the one who appeared on the earth in a human body. God's Spirit showed/demonstrated that he is/was truly the Messiah (OR, that he always acted righteously); Angels saw him; people preached about him in many nations; People in many parts of the world believed the message about him. God took him up into heaven.
66016021	Violence	Also as a result of the angel's emptying his bowl, huge hailstones, each weighing about 100 pounds, fell from the sky onto the people. Then people insulted God because he had caused the terrible plague of destructive hail to fall on them.
61003013	Faith	Although all those events/things will happen, we rejoice because we are waiting for the new heavens and new earth that God has promised. The only people who will be in the new heavens and on this new earth will be people who are [PRS] righteous.
66006014	Description	The sky split open and rolled up on either side just [SIM] like an old scroll rolls up when it is split in two. Every mountain and island moved out of its place.
58010010	Grace	Because of Jesus Christ doing what God wanted him to do, we have been set apart { he has set us apart} for God by his offering his own body only once as a sacrifice, a sacrifice that will not need to be repeated.
52001002	Faith	We always thank God for you all when we mention you while we pray (OR, when we pray for you).
66006004	Violence	Then a red horse came out. The one sitting on it was allowed { God allowed the one sitting on it} to cause people to no longer live peacefully, but instead to be killing each other. For this purpose he was given { God's agent gave to him} a large sword.
54006001	Recommendation	As for slaves [DOU] who are believers, teach them that they should consider that it is right for them to honor their masters in every way. If they do that, people will not speak ◄against/evil about► God [MTY] and they will not speak ◄against/evil about► that which we apostles teach, because they will see that the slaves are being respectful of their masters.
51003009	Recommendation	Do not lie to one another. Do not do those things, because you have ◄disposed of/stopped obeying► your former evil nature and stopped doing what you did when you had that former evil nature,
66002020	Sin	Nevertheless, I have this complaint against you: You tolerate that woman among your members who is like [MET] that wicked queen Jezebel who lived long ago. She says that she ◄is a prophetess/proclaims messages that come directly from God►, but by what she teaches she is deceiving my servants. She is urging them to practice sexual immorality and to eat food that they have offered to idols.
48003008	Grace	Furthermore, God planned beforehand that it was when non-Jews trusted him that he would erase the record of their sins. Moses wrote in the Scriptures [PRS] this good message that God told Abraham: “Because of what you did, I will bless people in [MTY] all nations.”
58012005	Recommendation	Do not forget [RHQ] these words that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as God would exhort you as his children: My child, pay attention [LIT] when the Lord is disciplining you, and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you [DOU],
58013017	Recommendation	Obey your spiritual leaders and do what they tell you, since they are the ones who are guarding your spiritual welfare [SYN]. Some day they will have to stand before God so that he can say if he approves of what they have done. Obey them in order that they can do the work of guarding you joyfully and not have to do it sadly, because if you cause them to do it sadly, that will certainly not help you at all (OR, they will not be able to help you at all).
44013019	Description	He enabled the Israelites to conquer seven tribal groups who were then living in Canaan region, and he gave their land to us Israelites for us to possess.
54006003	Faith	Some people teach things that are different. What they teach ◄does not agree with/is not like► the correct teaching that our Lord Jesus Christ taught (OR, that is about our Lord Jesus Christ). They do not say that we should conduct our lives ◄in a godly manner/in a manner that pleases God►.
63001010	Recommendation	So when anyone comes to you who teaches something different from what Christ taught, do not welcome him into your homes! Do not encourage him by ◄wishing him well/greeting him as a fellow believer► in any way!
47001005	Grace	It is true that just like Christ suffered, we who serve him also continually suffer because we belong to him. But also, because we belong to Christ, God greatly strengthens us just as/just like► God strengthened him.
65001011	Sin	God will do terrible things to those who teach false doctrine! They conduct their lives wickedly like Cain, who murdered his brother because he was ◄ jealous/angry because God accepted his brother's sacrifice and did not accept his►. They ◄devote themselves to [MET] doing wrong things like Balaam, who tried to induce God's people to sin in order to get the money that was offered to him. They will perish like Korah, who rebelled against the authority that God gave to Moses►.
65001010	Sin	But the ones in your midst who teach false doctrine ◄revile/speak evil against► the spiritual beings that they do not understand. They also do the evil things that they desire, things that they know about ◄naturally/without needing to think►, things that they just do without considering the consequences/results, like animals. So they destroy themselves. But they will also be punished by God { God will also punish them}.
58011007	Faith	It was because Noah trusted God that after he was warned by God {after God warned him} about a flood that had not yet happened, Noah showed that he revered God by building a huge ship to save his family. By doing that, he showed all the people who did not believe him [MTY] that they deserved to be condemned { that God would condemn them}. He became one whom God declared to be righteous because of his trusting in God.
58009006	Description	After all those things were prepared {After they had prepared all those things like that} in the two rooms of the tent, the Jewish priests habitually went into the outer room of the tent to perform their rituals.
44007051	Sin	“You people are extremely stubborn [MET], not wanting to obey God or listen [MTY] to him! You are exactly like your ancestors! You always resist the Holy Spirit as they did
54001009	Sin	We must remember that God did not give Moses those laws in order to condemn righteous people. By those laws he condemns people who act as though there were no laws and who refuse to obey anyone. He condemns those who do not revere God and those who sin habitually. By them he condemns those who refuse to perform rituals that are pleasing to God and who show no respect for religion. He condemns those who murder their fathers and who murder their mothers and who murder other people.
46005009	Recommendation	In the previous letter that I wrote to you, I said that you should not associate with sexually immoral people.
48001015	Grace	Nevertheless, before I was born God ◄set me apart/selected me►. He chose me to live eternally, something that I did not deserve.
45007015	Description	The things that I do, I often [HYP] do not understand. That is, sometimes [HYP] it is the good things that I want to do that I do not do. And sometimes [HYP] it is the evil things that I detest that I do.
61003018	Faith	Instead, live in such a manner that you experience more and more our Savior Jesus Christ acting kindly towards you, and that you get to know him better and better. I pray that Jesus Christ will always be honored. Peter 3:18b I pray/desire that Jesus Christ will be honored both now and forever!*
46004010	Description	Many people consider us to be [IRO] fools because we preach about Christ, but you proudly think [IRO] that you are wise because ◄of your close relationship with/you belong to► Christ. Many people consider us [IRO] to be unimpressive, but you proudly think that you impress others. People respect you, but they do not respect us.
60005009	Faith	You must resist him by continuing to firmly trust in Christ and his message, remembering that your fellow believers all over the world are experiencing similar sufferings that the devil is bringing to them.
51003022	Recommendation	You slaves, obey your earthly masters in every circumstance. Do not obey your masters only when they are watching [MTY] you, like those who merely want to impress their masters favorably. Instead, obey your masters sincerely. Do this because you reverence the Lord Jesus (OR, God).
66017012	Description	The ten horns that you saw represent ten rulers who have not yet begun to rule. They will receive authority in order to rule people together with the beast for only a short time, as if it were [MET] for one hour.
46002012	Grace	It was not the ideas that unbelievers teach that we accepted. Instead, it was the Spirit who came from God that we received, in order that we might know the things that God has freely done for us.
59005001	Recommendation	Now I have something to say to the rich people who do not believe in Christ and who ◄ oppress you/cause you to suffer►. Listen to me, you rich people! You should weep and wail loudly [DOU] because you will experience terrible troubles [PRS]!
66002010	Recommendation	Do not be afraid of any of the things that you are about to suffer. The truth is that the devil is about to put some of you in prison, to tempt you to deny that you believe in me. For a short period of time you will suffer because of what people will do to you [MTY]. Continue to trust in me, even if they kill you because you trust in me. As a result, I will reward you with eternal life, just like [MET] people reward a victorious athlete by putting a wreath on his head.
54006011	Recommendation	But as for you, who are a man who serves God, ◄keep completely away from such love of money/do not be like the people who love money►. Decide that you will do what is right, and that you will ◄be godly/do what pleases God►. Decide that you will trust God, and that you will love others. Endure difficult circumstances. Always be gentle with people.
59005005	Sin	You have lived luxuriously, just to have pleasure here on earth. Just like cattle fatten themselves, not realizing that they will be slaughtered [MET], you have lived just for pleasure [MTY], not realizing that God will severely punish you.
66004004	Description	Around the throne there were twenty-four other thrones. On these thrones twenty-four elders were sitting. They were wearing pure white garments and had golden crowns on their heads.
66018007	Description	To the same extent that they have honored themselves and done the things that they wanted to do, to that extent torment them and cause them to grieve. Do that because in their minds they think, ‘We rule as queens! We are not widows, and we will never mourn as widows do!’
60003007	Recommendation	You men who are believers, just like your wives should respect you, you should conduct your lives in an appropriate way with them. Treat them respectfully, realizing that they are usually weaker than you are, and realizing that ◄they share with you/both of you have► the gift that God has kindly given to you, which is eternal life. Do this so that nothing will hinder you from praying (OR, hinder God ◄ from answering/from doing what you ask for► when you pray).
54002012	Recommendation	I do not permit women to teach men spiritual truth publicly, and I do not permit them to have authority over men. Instead, I desire that women listen quietly during the worship services.
46001009	Faith	You can depend on God to do that. He is the one who chose you to become intimately associated with his Son, Jesus Christ, who is our Lord.
48005013	Recommendation	My fellow believers, God chose you in order that you might live without having to obey rules and rituals. But do not assume that because you are free from having to obey rules and rituals, God permits you to do whatever your self-directed nature desires. Instead, constantly, as you love each other, serve each other.
59002012	Recommendation	Continually speak and act toward others as people should who will be judged {whom God will judge} by the law that frees us from being punished { God punishing us} for our sins.
46012005	Faith	There are many different ways to serve the Lord, but it is the same Lord whom we all are serving.
45009005	Description	It was our ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whom God chose to found our nation. And, most importantly, it was from us Israelites that the Messiah received his human nature. Nevertheless, most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ, who is the one who controls all things! He is God, the one who is worthy that we praise him forever! This is true! (OR, Amen!)
47001006	Description	So, whenever we (exc) experience sufferings, we learn how to encourage you when you experience sufferings. As a result, you will become more and more the kind of people God wants you to be. Whenever God strengthens us (exc) in our sufferings, he does that in order that you may see how he makes us strong when we are suffering. Then, as God encourages you in that way, you will learn to continue patiently trusting him when you suffer as we do.
47001021	Faith	Now it is only God himself who causes us (exc), as well as you, to keep on believing strongly in Christ. God is the one who chose us (inc) to belong to him and to have a close relationship with Christ.
44010015	Recommendation	Then Peter heard [MTY] God talk to him a second time. He said, “ I am God, so if I have made something acceptable to eat, do not say that it is not acceptable to eat!”
66018009	Sin	“The kings of the earth who have acted immorally with people of those cities and have lived with the people of those cities, doing just what they wanted to do, will weep and mourn [DOU] for them when they see the smoke of the fire that is burning them.
43014023	Faith	Jesus replied to him, “Those who love me will obey what I have told them. My Father will also love them. It is those people whom my Father and I will be able to come to and ◄live with/have a personal relationship with►.
62004010	Grace	And God has shown us what it means to love another person: It does not mean that we loved God, but it means that God loved us and sent ◄his Son/the one who was also God► to sacrifice his life in order that our sins might be forgiven { he might forgive our sins}.
62001007	Faith	But living in a pure manner, as God is living in a pure manner [MET] in every way, is like living in God's light. If we do that, we have a close relationship with each other. Not only that, but God ◄acquits us/removes the guilt► of all our sins because he accepts what his Son Jesus did for us when his blood flowed from his body when he died. So we should conduct our lives ◄ in a manner according to what God says is pure►.
48004007	Grace	So, because of what God has done, no longer is each of you like a slave. Instead, each of you is a child of God. Furthermore, since each of you is God's child, God has also made you his heir, one who will receive all that he has promised.
58001008	Faith	But on the other hand, in the Scriptures it is written that God said this to his Son: You (sg) who are also God will rule forever [MTY], and you will reign righteously over your kingdom [MTY].
43010033	Sin	The Jewish leaders [SYN] replied, “We are wanting to throw stones at you not because you performed a great miracle. Instead, we are wanting to do it because you are dishonoring God. You are just a man, but you are saying that you are God!”
66014011	Description	The smoke from the fire that torments them will rise forever. They will be tormented { God will torment them} continually, day and night. That is what will happen to the people who worship the beast and its image and who allow its name to be marked on them {allow its agent to mark them with its name}.”
47004001	Faith	So, because God has acted so kindly toward me enabling me to teach this great message to people, I never get so discouraged that I stop teaching it.
58013006	Faith	So we can say confidently as the Psalmist said, Since the Lord is the one who helps me, I will not be afraid! ◄People can do nothing to me that will deprive me of God's blessings./What can people do to me that will deprive me of God's blessings?► [RHQ]
45014003	Recommendation	Anyone who thinks that it is all right to eat all kinds of food must not despise those who think it is not all right to eat all kinds of food. Anyone who thinks it is not all right to eat all kinds of food must not ◄condemn/say that God will punish► those who think that it is all right to eat all kinds of food, because God himself has accepted those people.
45015005	Grace	God is the one who enables us to be patient and who encourages us. ◄ Ask/Pray to► him that he would enable you all to live harmoniously with each other, doing as Christ Jesus did.
58007027	Description	The Jewish high priests need to sacrifice animals day by day as well as year by year. They do this, firstly, to atone for their own sins, and then to atone for other people who have sinned. But because Jesus never sinned, he does not need to do that. The only thing he needed to do to save people was to sacrifice himself once!
62003017	Sin	Many of us have the things that are necessary for us to live in this world. If we become aware that any of our fellow believers do not have what they need and if we refuse to ◄ provide for them/give to them what they need►, it is clear that we do not love God as we claim/say that we do.
47005008	Faith	As I said, we (exc) are confident that he will give us new bodies. We (exc) would much prefer to leave these bodies in which we are now living, and be with the Lord Jesus in our home in heaven.
60002011	Recommendation	You people whom I love, I urge you to consider that you are like foreigners [MET, DOU] whose real home is in heaven. As a result, avoid doing the things that your self-directed nature desires, because those desires ◄fight against/always oppose► your souls.
60002017	Recommendation	Act respectfully toward everyone. Love all your fellow believers. Revere God, and honor the king.
44007025	Description	Moses was thinking that his fellow Israelites would understand that God had sent him to free them from being slaves. But they did not understand that.
50003002	Violence	Beware of those people who are dangerous [MET] like wild dogs. They are dangerous evildoers [DOU]. Beware of them since they are like people who cut other people's bodies [MET]. They will harm you spiritually by insisting that you must let someone circumcise you in order for you to become God's people [MTY, MET].
56001016	Sin	Even though they claim/say that they know God, by what they do they show that they do not know ◄God/his true teaching►. They do not obey God, and they are unable to do anything that he considers to be good. So God considers them to be absolutely disgusting!
45010002	Faith	I declare truthfully about them that although they ◄zealously seek/very much want to know► God, they do not understand how to seek/know him correctly.
47001004	Grace	He has encouraged us (exc) whenever we suffered hardships. As a result, we (exc) are able to encourage others whenever they suffer hardships, just as/just like ◄God has encouraged us (exc).
55002015	Recommendation	◄Do your best/Try hard► to be the kind of person that God will approve of. Be like a good workman as you teach the true message accurately. If a workman works well, he will not need to be ashamed of (OR, will be pleased about) what he does.
53002004	Description	He will be the supreme enemy of God. He will proudly exalt himself above everything that people consider to be God and above everything that people worship. As a result of wanting people to worship him, he will even enter God's Temple and sit down there to rule He will publicly proclaim that he himself is God! But God will certainly punish that man forever!
49006004	Recommendation	You parents (OR, You fathers), do not treat your children so severely that they become angry. Instead, bring them up well by instructing them and by disciplining them in the manner that the Lord Jesus wants you to do.
45008037	Grace	But even though all these bad things may happen to us, we win completely/triumphantly over these things because Christ, who loves us, helps us.
44026014	Violence	We (exc) all fell to the ground. Then I heard the voice of someone speaking to me in my own Hebrew language [MTY]. He said ‘Saul, Saul, ◄stop causing me to suffer!/why are you causing me to suffer?► [RHQ] You (sg) are hurting yourself by trying to hurt me [MET], like an ox kicking against its owner's goad.’
66002009	Sin	I know that you suffer because of what unbelievers do to you, and that you lack material possessions. But I also know that you are spiritually [MET] rich. I know that people ◄slander/say evil things about► you. They say that they are Jews, but I do not consider that they are Jews. I consider that they belong to the assembly that Satan controls!
46013006	Faith	Those who [PRS] truly love others do not rejoice when people do evil things, but they do rejoice when people act righteously.
59001021	Recommendation	So stop doing all kinds of evil [DOU], and humbly accept (OR, submit to) the message that God planted in your ◄inner beings/hearts►, because he is able to save you [SYN] if you accept his message.
46003006	Grace	I was the first one who preached God's message to you. I was like [MET] someone who plants seeds. Later, Apollos taught you more of God's message. That was like [MET] someone who waters plants after they start to grow. But it is God who enables people to grow spiritually, just like he is the one who causes plants to grow.
66014008	Sin	Another angel, the second one, came after him saying, “The very evil cities (OR, city) represented by Babylon are completely destroyed! God has punished their people because they have persuaded people of all the nations to forsake God, just like a prostitute [MET] persuades men to drink strong wine and as a result commit sexual immorality.”
43015014	Recommendation	You show that you are my friends if you keep doing what I have commanded you.
62005021	Recommendation	I say to you who are very dear to me, guard/keep yourselves from worshipping gods that have no real power
55003006	Sin	because some such people, even now, subtly/deceivingly persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses, and then they deceive those women so that they control what those women think. These women have been burdened with sins {have sinned very much} and they have been led to do {they do} the many evil things that they strongly desire to do.
49004015	Faith	Instead, by loving others as we behave according to God's truth (OR, speak in a loving manner what is true), we will become more and more like Christ in every way. He is the one who controls/guides all his people [MET], just like a person's head controls/guides his body.
49004003	Faith	God's Spirit has caused you to be united with one another, so do all that you can to remain united with one another by acting peacefully toward each other.
44009005	Description	Saul asked him, “Lord, who are you?” He replied, “I am Jesus, and you (sg) are causing me to suffer by hurting my followers!
60003015	Recommendation	Instead, acknowledge in your ◄inner beings/hearts► that Christ is the one who is in complete control of your lives. Always be ready to answer everyone who demands that you tell them about what you confidently expect God to do for you.
44007033	Recommendation	Then the Lord God said to him, ‘Take your sandals off to show that you(sg) reverence me. Because I am here, the place where you are standing is holy/sacred.
62002024	Faith	So, as for you, you must continue to conduct your lives according to the true message that you heard when you began [MTY] to believe in Christ. If you continue to do that, you will continue to have a close relationship with both God's Son and the Father.
43008051	Faith	But the truth is that anyone who obeys what I say will never die!”
66020011	Description	Then I saw a huge white throne on which God was sitting. He was so awesome that the earth and the sky disappeared from his presence completely; they were completely destroyed { God completely destroyed them}.
46006013	Recommendation	Some of you may also say, “Food is just for us to put in the stomach, and the stomach is just for us to put food in. And since God will do away with food and stomachs when he gives us our new bodies, what we do with our bodies sexually does not affect us anymore than eating food does.” But what you have concluded is wrong, because the Lord does not want us to use our bodies to do sexually immoral things. Instead, the Lord wants us to use our bodies in ways that please him. Also, the Lord wants us to do what is good for our bodies.
45006011	Faith	Similarly, you must consider that it is as though you have become unable to do what your sinful desires [MET] want, as a corpse is not able to do what anyone wants it to do. You must also consider that because of your relationship to Christ Jesus you are living in a new way in order to serve/honor God.
47002014	Faith	However, before I tell you anymore about that, I want to thank God for what he is doing. As a great leader of fighting men causes all his prisoners to take part in his victory parade [MET], God leads us who are his workers to always win out over Satan because of our(exc) close relationship with Christ. God causes people to come to know Jesus Christ as a result of our (exc) teaching his message. That message is like [MET] the smell of perfume.
62001005	Grace	The message that we heard from Christ and proclaim to you is this: God is pure in every way. He never sins. He is like [MET] a brilliant light that has no darkness at all.
43006037	Grace	All the people that my Father entrusts to me will come to me, and I will certainly ◄welcome/never send away► [LIT] anyone who comes to me.
58013001	Recommendation	Continue to love your fellow believers.
58007025	Grace	So, he can completely and eternally save those who come to God by trusting in what Christ has done for them, since he lives forever to plead with God to help them.
43019015	Violence	They shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Have him crucified {Command your soldiers to nail him to a cross}!” Pilate said to them, “ He is your king! Do you really want me to tell my soldiers to nail him to a cross?” The chief priests replied, “The Emperor is our king! We do not have any other king!”
45011005	Grace	So, similarly, there is also at this time a small group of us Jews who have become believers. God has chosen us to become believers (OR, his people) only because he acts kindly toward us, in ways that we do not deserve.
66017002	Sin	It is as though the rulers of earth have acted immorally and idolatrously with the people of that city [MET], and they have persuaded people who live on the earth to act immorally and idolatrously with them [MET], just like a prostitute persuades men to drink the strong wine she gives them, resulting in their becoming drunk and committing immorality.”
45012010	Recommendation	Love one another as members of the same family do; and in regard to honoring one another, you should be ◄the first ones/eager► to do it!
45008014	Faith	We who are guided by the Spirit of God {allow the Spirit of God to guide us} are God's children.
66012003	Description	Something else very unusual appeared in the sky. It was a huge red dragon. It had seven heads and ten horns. On each of its heads was a royal crown.
45008017	Faith	Because we are God's children, we also will some day receive/inherit eternal blessings/privileges. We will receive/inherit them from God, and we will also receive/inherit them just like Christ has inherited them. But we must suffer for doing good as Christ did, in order to receive splendor as he did.
54005017	Recommendation	Each congregation should pay well the elders who lead well. They should greatly honor them, especially those who preach and those who teach.
46008007	Sin	Nevertheless, some people do not understand that idols are not really alive. In the past, some among you who are believers now were accustomed to believing that idols were really alive. As a result, when they eat such meat now, they still think that it was sacrificed to an idol that is alive. They are not sure that God allows believers to eat meat that has been offered to idols. So, when they eat such meat, they think that they have sinned.
43015002	Grace	Just like a gardener cuts off the branches that bear no grapes [MET], God gets rid of those who do not please him even though they say that they belong to him. Those branches that bear fruit, the gardener trims so that they may bear more grapes. Similarly, my Father disciplines/corrects those who live as he wants them to live.
60005003	Recommendation	Do not act like domineering bosses over the people [MET] whom God has assigned/entrusted to you, but instead be examples to them by the way in which you conduct your lives.
52004013	Recommendation	My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well [LIT] what will happen to our fellow believers who now are dead [EUP]. You must not be/do like the unbelievers. They grieve deeply for people who die because they do not confidently expect people to live again after they die.
58011029	Description	It was because they trusted God that when the Israelite people walked through where the Red Sea had been, it was as though they walked on dry land! But, when the army of Egypt also attempted to cross that same water, they drowned, because the sea came back and flooded them!
44007020	Description	“During that time Moses was born, and he was a very beautiful [LIT] child. So his parents secretly cared for him in their house for three months.
58005002	Grace	The high priests could deal gently with those who ignorantly sinned, since they themselves tended to sin easily.
45013012	Recommendation	Our time to live in this world [MTY] is almost ended [MET], like a night that is nearly ended. The time when Christ will return [MTY] is near. So we must quit doing wicked deeds [MET] such as people do in the darkness, and we must be doing the things that will help us resist Satan/evil [MET], as soldiers who put on their armor in the daytime get ready to resist their enemies.
49006009	Recommendation	You masters, just like your slaves should serve you well, you similarly must treat them well. Stop threatening to beat them if they do not do their work well. Do not forget that the one who is their Lord and your Lord is in heaven. So he is the one who will say to you and your slaves whether he approves of what you and they have done, and when he judges people, he does not act more favorably toward some than he acts toward others.
45012015	Recommendation	If someone is joyful, you should rejoice also! If someone is sad, you should also be sad!
45002005	Sin	But instead, by your stubbornly refusing to turn away from your sinful behavior [DOU], you are causing [MET] God to punish you even more severely. He will do that at the time when he shows that he is angry and judges people fairly.
44014019	Violence	However, after that, some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded many of the people of Lystra that the message Paul had been telling them was not true. The people who believed what those Jews said became angry with Paul. They let the Jews throw stones at him until he fell down, unconscious. They all thought that he was dead, so they dragged him outside the city and left him lying there. But some of the believers in Lystra had followed them outside the city.
43013021	Description	After Jesus said this, he was very troubled within himself. He solemnly declared, “Listen to this carefully: One of you is going to enable my enemies to seize me.”
48003022	Faith	But instead, what we read in the Scriptures [PRS] is that God caused all people to be unable to escape being punished for their sins [MET], just like people in prison are unable to escape [PRS, MET]. God did that in order that he might give what he promised to those who trust Jesus Christ, just because they trust him.
66011007	Violence	When they have finished proclaiming to people the message from God, the beast that comes up ◄from the underworld/from the deep dark pit► will attack them, overcome them, and will kill them.
58003014	Faith	We must do that, because we (inc) benefit in all Christ has done only if we firmly keep trusting in him from the time when we first confidently trusted in him until the time when we die [EUP].
45008010	Faith	But since Christ is living in you/us by his Spirit, although your/our bodies are certain to die because you/we sin, your/our spirits are alive because God has erased the record of your/our sins.
44007052	Sin	Your ancestors caused [RHQ] every prophet to suffer, including Moses. They even killed those who long ago announced that the Messiah would come, the one who always did what pleased God. And the Messiah has come! He is the one whom you recently turned over to his enemies and insisted that they kill him!
48005021	Sin	People want what others have. People get drunk. People ◄revel/participate in wild parties►. And people do other things like these. I warn you now, just like I warned you previously, that the ones who constantly act and think like this will not receive what God has for his own people when he begins to rule over us.
43012036	Faith	Believe in my message [MET] while you still have an opportunity to do it, in order that you may become people who have accepted my truth [MET]!” Most of the Jewish leaders continued to reject Jesus' message. John 12:36b-43 After Jesus said those things, he left them and hid from them.
58003002	Faith	He faithfully served God, who appointed him, just like Moses faithfully served God's people [MTY].
56003006	Grace	Because we trusted in Jesus Christ our Savior, God put the Holy Spirit within us in order to wonderfully change us.
44004036	Description	For example, there was Joseph. He was a descendant of Levi and he was born on Cyprus Island. The apostles called him Barnabas; in the Jewish language that name means a person who [IDM] always encourages others.
48006009	Recommendation	But we should not ◄tire of/become discouraged while► doing what pleases God, because eventually, at the time that God has determined, we will receive a reward [MET], if we do not stop doing the good things that we have been doing.
48002019	Faith	When I realized that I could not earn God's favor by obeying the laws that he gave to Moses, I decided not to respond to what those laws demanded [MET], just like a dead person does not respond to anything. Now I live to honor/serve God.
66011001	Recommendation	An angel gave to me a reed similar to a measuring stick. He said to me, “ Christ says this: ‘Go to the temple where people worship God, measure it and the altar in it, and count the people who worship there.
66014004	Description	Those 144,000 are the people who are spiritually pure, like virgins are morally pure. They have not ◄defiled themselves/made themselves impure► [MET] by worshipping any false god. They are the ones who accompany Jesus, the one who is like a lamb, wherever he goes. They represent all those whom he has redeemed/bought for God from among the people of earth, in order that he might offer them to God and to himself.
66009007	Description	The locusts looked like horses that are ready for battle. They had on their heads what looked like golden crowns. Their faces were like the faces of people.
60002016	Recommendation	Conduct your lives as though you were free from having to obey authorities, but do not think “Because I am free from having to obey authorities, I can do what is evil.” Instead, act as servants of God should.
54004010	Faith	This is the reason why we work so hard [DOU] for others, because we confidently expect that God, who is all-powerful, will do the things that he has promised. He is the one who wants to save all people, so he protects them. He certainly protects us who believe in Christ!
58010029	Sin	That was severe punishment. But Christ is ◄God's Son/the man who is also God►. His blood, by means of which he put into effect the new covenant, is sacred. Because of Christ's [MTY] blood flowing for us when he died, God freed us from our guilt. So, you can be sure [RHQ] that anyone who shows contempt for those truths and who insults the Spirit of God, the one who acts with kindness toward us in a way we do not deserve, deserves to be punished even worse than that [MET]!
43020021	Grace	Jesus said to us again, “May God give you peace! Just like my Father sent me, now I am sending you to proclaim my message.”
65001016	Sin	Those teachers of false doctrine grumble about the things that God does. They complain about what happens to them. They do the sinful things that their bodies desire. They talk boastfully. They ◄flatter/say nice things to► people, only in order to get those people to give them the things that they want.
66006015	Description	As a result, all the rebellious people of the earth, including kings, high-ranking people, generals, the rich people, the powerful people, along with every body else, both slave and free, hid themselves in caves and between the mountain rocks.
66021008	Sin	But those who are cowardly, those who do not believe in me, those who do detestable things, those who are murderers, those who sin sexually, those who commit sorcery, those who worship idols, and every liar, will all suffer in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. Anyone who suffers in that lake will be dying the second time.”
44022016	Recommendation	So now ◄do not delay!/why delay?► [RHQ] Stand up, let me baptize you, and by praying to the Lord Jesus ask God to forgive you (sg) for your sins!’ ”
66009008	Description	They had long hair like the long hair of women. Their teeth were strong, like lions' teeth.
55002024	Recommendation	But those who serve the Lord must not quarrel. Instead, they should be kind to all people, they should be ◄able to teach God's truth well/good teachers►, and they should be patient with people.
51002005	Faith	because, even though I am absent from you physically, I am very concerned about you. At the same time, I am rejoicing because I know that you are united with each other and that you believe firmly in Christ.
60003012	Sin	because the Lord sees [MTY] what righteous people do and he appreciates/likes what they do. He listens to righteous people when they pray and he answers them. But he is [MTY] opposed to those who do evil.
53002013	Faith	Our fellow believers, whom our Lord Jesus loves, we thank God very frequently for you. It is appropriate/right for us to do that, because God chose you ◄from the beginning [MTY] of creation/before the world existed► in order that he might save you as a result of your believing the true message and as a result of God's Spirit setting you apart for God.
66022011	Recommendation	Since that time is near, if those who act in an evil manner want to continue to act that way [IRO], that is up to them. God will soon ◄ pay them back/punish them► for that. If those who are vile want to continue to be vile [IRO], that is up to them. God will soon ◄ pay them back/punish them► for that. Those who are acting righteously should continue to act righteously. Those who are holy should continue to be holy.”
44002038	Faith	Peter answered them, “Each of you should turn away from your sinful behavior. Then we(exc) will baptize you, if you now believe in Jesus Christ. Then God will give you the Holy Spirit.
52005015	Recommendation	Make sure that none of you does evil deeds to anyone who has done evil to you. On the contrary, you must always try to do good deeds to each other (OR, to fellow believers) and to everyone else.
45001027	Sin	Similarly, many men stopped having/did not have natural sexual relations with women [EUP]. Instead, they strongly desired to have sexual relations with other men. They committed homosexual acts with other men, acts that were shameful. As a result, God has punished them by sicknesses in their bodies, which is what they deserve because they thought wrongly that God would not punish them for doing that.
50002018	Recommendation	Similarly, you too should rejoice because you are giving yourselves wholly to God, and you should rejoice because I am giving myself wholly to God.
44003019	Recommendation	So, turn away from your sinful behavior and ask God to help you do what pleases him, in order that he may completely forgive you for your sins.
66021025	Description	The gates of the city will not be shut {No one will shut the gates of the city} at the end of the day as they usually are shut, because there will be no night there.
43006054	Faith	Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will cause them to become alive again at ◄the last day/the judgment day►,
43019011	Sin	Jesus replied, “The only authority you have is what has been given to you by God [MTY] {what God [MTY] has given you}. The high priest put me into your hands. He has done to me what he wanted to do, and you do not really want to do it. So he is guilty of committing a greater sin than you are.”
59002017	Faith	Similarly, those who do not do good deeds to help others, what they have said about their believing in Christ is as useless [MET] as a dead person is useless They do not really believe in Christ.
45008003	Sin	What we could not do by trying to obey the laws of God [PRS], because our self-directed nature was too weak to obey them, God did. He sent his own Son into the world in order that his Son might atone for our sin. His Son came having a body (OR, human nature) that was like the body (OR, the human nature) of us people who sin. By sending his Son in this way, he condemned and punished his Son, who never sinned, instead of punishing us, who sinned [MTY]. He did that by making his Son's body a sacrifice (OR, by causing his Son's body to suffer/die) for all our sin.
60003014	Recommendation	But even if you suffer because of doing what is right, God will bless you. Do as Isaiah wrote: “Do not be afraid of people who ◄threaten you/say things to cause you to be afraid of what they might do to you►, and do not worry about [DOU] what they might do to you.”
51003021	Recommendation	You parents (OR, you fathers), do not correct your children more than you need to, in order that they do not become discouraged.
66018002	Sin	He shouted with a very loud voice, “ God is about to completely destroy [DOU] all the very evil cities (OR, the very evil city) that Babylon represents. As a result, all kinds of evil spirits [DOU] will live there, and all kinds of foul and detestable [DOU] birds will live there.
62002022	Sin	The worst liars are the ones who deny that Jesus is ◄the Messiah/the one whom God chose to rescue us►. They are the ones that we told you about, the ones who oppose Christ. They refuse to acknowledge/admit that God is the Father and that Jesus is his Son (OR, the one who is also God).
46011027	Sin	So, those who eat that bread and drink that wine [MTY] in a way that is not proper for those who belong to the Lord are guilty of acting in a way that is contrary to what our Lord intended when he offered his body as a sacrifice and his blood flowed when he died.
59002020	Faith	Also, you foolish person, I will [RHQ] prove to you (sg) that if someone says, “I trust in God,” but he does not do good deeds, what that person says will not benefit him.
43018003	Description	So Judas came to that grove. He was leading a troop of Roman soldiers and some Temple guards who had been sent by the Pharisees and chief priests. They were carrying torches and lamps and weapons.
53003003	Grace	Remember that our Lord Jesus is trustworthy! So we are sure that he will cause you to continue to be steadfast. We are also sure that he will protect you from Satan, the evil one (OR, from evil).
44007021	Description	Then they had to put him outside the house, but Pharaoh's daughter found him and adopted him and cared for him as though he were her own son.
66008005	Description	In response, the angel took the golden incense burner and filled it with coals of fire from the altar. He threw the contents of the [MTY] incense burner onto the earth. Thunder sounded and rumbled, lightning was flashing, and the earth shook.
66018003	Sin	God will destroy those cities because their rulers have persuaded the people of [MTY] all nations to act very immorally and idolatrously with the people of [MET] those cities, just like a prostitute persuades men to drink strong wine and then commit fornication with her. The rulers of the earth have also acted immorally and idolatrously with the people of [MTY] those cities. The merchants of the earth have become rich because the people of those cities strongly desired and bought from the merchants many ◄luxuries/expensive things►.”
44026021	Violence	“It is because I preached this message that some [SYN] Jews seized me when I was in the Temple courtyard and tried to kill me.
55004004	Sin	That is, they will not listen to [MTY] what is true, but will listen instead to strange stories from our ancestors.
43006064	Faith	But there are some of you who do not believe my message.” Jesus said that because he knew from the time he started [MTY] his ministry which of them would not believe his message. He also knew who would ◄betray him/enable his enemies to seize him►.
43013026	Description	Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I dip it in the sauce in the dish.” Then, to show us that he knew who would enable his enemies to seize him, after he dipped the bread in the sauce, he gave it to Judas ◄Iscariot/the man from Kerioth village►.
54006020	Recommendation	Timothy, faithfully proclaim/protect the true message (OR, do the work) that Jesus has given to you. ◄Avoid/Do not listen to► people who want to chatter about things that are not important to God. ◄Avoid/Do not listen to► people who claim/say that they have ❛true knowledge❜ but who say things that oppose/contradict our true teaching.
44017005	Violence	But some leaders of the Jews there in Thessalonica became jealous because many people believed what Paul taught. So they went to the public square and persuaded some lazy men who were loitering there to follow them. In this way, the leaders of the Jews gathered a crowd and incited them to become noisy and start a riot against Paul and Silas. Those Jews and others ran to the house of a man named Jason. He was the man who had invited Paul and Silas to stay at his house. They wanted to bring Paul and Silas outside to where the crowd of people was waiting.
62005016	Sin	Those who see one of their fellow believers sinning in a way that does not result in being eternally separated from God should ask God to help that fellow believer ; and as a result God will help that fellow believer and enable him or her to live eternally. But some people sin in a manner that causes them to be separated from God eternally. I am not saying that you should ask God to help people who sin like that.
43013020	Faith	Listen to this carefully: Those who accept any one of you whom I am sending out, God will consider that they are accepting me. And those who accept me, God will consider that they are accepting my Father, who sent me.”
58012028	Faith	So, let us thank God that we are becoming members of a kingdom that nothing can shake. Let us worship/serve God in a way that pleases him by being greatly in awe [DOU] before him.
44019013	Description	There were also some Jews who traveled around to various places, and they commanded the evil spirits in those places to depart from them. Certain ones of those Jews once tried to command the evil spirits to come out of people by saying “I command you by the authority [MTY] of the Lord Jesus, the man about whom Paul preaches, to come out!”
44015040	Grace	Paul chose Silas, who had returned to Antioch, to work with him. The believers there asked the Lord God to graciously help Paul and Silas. Then the two of them departed from Antioch.
63001008	Recommendation	So be sure that you do not let those teachers deceive you! If you let them deceive you, you will lose the reward which we, together with you, have been working for, and you will not receive the complete reward of being eternally united to God!
66011006	Violence	Those witnesses will have authority over the sky in order to keep rain from falling during the time that they are proclaiming what God reveals to them. They also will have authority to cause water everywhere to become red like [MET] blood, and authority to send down to the earth all kinds of plagues. They will do this as often as they want to.
44008021	Sin	God has not authorized you to have any part of this ministry of giving the Holy Spirit's power, because he knows that you are not thinking rightly! (OR, because he knows that you are thinking completely wrongly.)
43017010	Faith	All the disciples that I have belong to you, and all those who belong to you also belong to me. They have shown how great I am.
45003012	Sin	Absolutely everyone has turned away [MET] from God. God considers them depraved (OR, Everyone has become useless to God). There is no one who acts righteously; no, there is not even one!
50002003	Recommendation	Never try to selfishly make yourselves more important than others nor boast about what you are doing. Instead, be humble, and in particular, honor one another more than you honor yourselves.
66001013	Description	I saw seven golden lampstands. In the midst of the lampstands there was someone who looked like one who came from heaven. He wore a robe that reached to his feet, and he wore a gold band around his chest.
66022003	Faith	There will never be anyone or anything there that God will curse. The throne of God and of the one who is like a lamb will be in the city. And his servants will worship him there.
60004007	Recommendation	It is almost the time when all things on this earth will come to an end. Therefore, keep thinking sensibly/reasonably and control what you think [DOU], so that you can pray clearly.
44014026	Grace	There they got on a ship and went back to Antioch city in Syria province. That was the place where Paul and Barnabas had been appointed {where believers had sent Paul and Barnabas} to go to other places and preach. Antioch was the place where the believers had asked God to kindly help Paul and Barnabas in the work that they had now completed.
46007028	Recommendation	But if any of you men get married, you have not committed a sin by doing that. Likewise, if an unmarried woman gets married, she has not committed a sin by doing that. However, those who get married will have many troubles, so I am urging you to remain unmarried in order that you may not experience such troubles.
49006012	Sin	You must do this because the fighting that we believers do is not only against human beings [SYN]. Instead, we are also fighting against evil spirits who rule and have authority over all that is evil [MET] in the world. We are fighting against evil spirits who are in heavenly places (OR, everywhere).
59001005	Recommendation	If anyone of you does not know how to act wisely in order to endure difficulties/trials well, he should ask God to show him what he should do, because God wholeheartedly/gladly helps all people who ask and does not scold anyone for asking. Those who ask, God will give them wisdom to know what they should do.
52005019	Recommendation	Do not refuse the urging from God's Spirit when he is working [MTY] among you. That would be like throwing water on a fire [MET]!
58009002	Description	That sanctuary was a tent that the Israelites set up. In its outer room there was the lampstand and the table on which they put the bread that the priests presented to God. That room was called ❛the holy place❜.
66003018	Recommendation	I advise you to obtain from me all that you need spiritually, as though you were buying from me gold that has been refined by fire {that fire has refined}, in order that you may be truly rich [MET] spiritually. Let me make you righteous, as though you were [MET] buying from me white garments in order that you might wear clothes instead of being naked and ashamed. Let me help you to perceive spiritual things, as though [MET] you were buying from me eye salve in order to anoint your eyes in order that you might see.
62005013	Faith	I have written this letter to you who believe that Jesus is [MTY] ◄God's Son/the one who is also God► in order that you may know that you have eternal life.
43007018	Faith	Those who speak with only their own authority do that only so that others will honor them. But I am doing things so that others will honor the one who sent me, and I am someone who speaks the truth. I never lie.
47004007	Grace	This work that God has given to us (exc) is [MET] like a very valuable treasure. But we who have that treasure are as weak as fragile [MET] clay pots. God has planned it like that in order that people will know that the power that changes lives is God's power, and not any power of our own.
45012019	Recommendation	My fellow believers whom I love, do not do evil in return when people do evil to you! Instead, allow God to punish them [MTY], because it is {someone has} written in the Scriptures that the Lord said, “ ‘It is my responsibility to take revenge; I am the one who will punish people who do evil to you [DOU],’ says the Lord.”
43008054	Faith	Jesus replied, “If I were honoring myself, that would be worthless. My Father is the one who you say is your God. He is the one who honors me.
45014020	Recommendation	Do not destroy what God has done in the life of any believer just because of your eating certain kinds of food [MET] which that person considers wrong to eat! God permits us to eat every kind of food. But if, by your eating certain kinds of food, you encourage another person to sin by doing what he believes is wrong, you are doing wrong.
43019040	Description	They took the body of Jesus and wrapped strips of linen cloth around it, putting the spices in with the strips of cloth. They did this according to the Jewish customs about burying bodies in tombs.
58010034	Faith	You not only were kind to those who were in prison because they believed in Christ, but you also accepted it joyfully when unbelievers took away your possessions. You accepted it because you yourselves knew very well that you have eternal possessions in heaven that are much better than those that they took from you!
44013023	Grace	“From among David's descendants, God brought one of them, Jesus, to us Israelite people to save us, just like he had told David and our other ancestors that he would do.
46002009	Faith	But we believers need to remember these words that a prophet wrote in the Scriptures: Things that no one has ever seen, things that no one ever heard, things that no one ever thought could happen, those are the things that God has prepared for those who love him.
45008011	Grace	God caused Jesus to live again after he died. And because his Spirit lives in you/us, God will also make your/our bodies, which now are sure to die, live again after you/we die. God, who caused Christ to live again after he died, will make you/us live again by causing his Spirit, who lives within you/us, to do it.
45008016	Faith	The Spirit himself confirms what our spirits say, that we are God's children.
48006007	Recommendation	You should not deceive yourselves. Remember that God is never outwitted {no one ever fools God}. Just like a farmer will reap exactly the kind of crop that he plants [MET], God will reward people according to what they have done [MET].
45011022	Grace	Note then, that God acts kindly, but he also acts severely. He has acted severely toward the Jews who have stopped ◄trusting in/obeying► him. On the other hand, he acts kindly toward each of you non-Jews only if you continue to appreciate his acting kindly toward you. However, you will be rejected { he will reject you} if you do not keep trusting in him.
59005007	Recommendation	So, my fellow believers, although rich people cause you to suffer, be patient until the Lord Jesus Christ comes back. Remember that when farmers plant a field, they wait for their valuable crops to grow. They must wait patiently for the rain that comes at the planting season and for more rain that comes just before the harvest season. They wait for the crops to grow and mature before they can harvest them.
55001016	Grace	But I pray that the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus for the following reasons: Often he refreshed me and, even though I was a prisoner [MTY], he was not ashamed ◄of me/ to admit he was my friend►.
62002028	Faith	Now, while some people are trying to persuade you to accept their false teaching, I urge you, who are all very dear to me, to continue to have a close relationship with Christ. We need to do that in order that we may be confident that he will accept us when he comes back again. If we do that, we will not be ashamed when we stand before him when he comes.
48005016	Recommendation	So I tell you this: Constantly let God's Spirit direct you. If you do that, you will certainly not do the things that your self-directed nature wants you to do.
54001015	Grace	Something that all we believers say is certainly true and is worthy for us to fully accept is that Christ Jesus came into the world in order to save sinful people so that God would not punish them for their sins. As for me, I consider that I have sinned more than all others.
49006010	Faith	Finally, at all times rely/depend completely on the Lord Jesus to strengthen you spiritually by his own mighty power.

58011036	Violence	Other people who trusted God were mocked; some had their backs cut open by being struck with whips. Some were chained and put in prison.
58006019	Faith	Our confidently expecting [SYN] to receive what he has promised is like an anchor [MET] that very firmly [DOU] holds us fast. The one we confidently expect to help us [SYN] is Jesus, who goes into God's very presence, just like the high priests went behind the curtain into the innermost part of the tent in the barren area [MET].
49005011	Recommendation	Do not do the worthless deeds that the people ◄who are in spiritual darkness/who do not know God's truth► [MET] do. Instead, let others know that those people's deeds are worthless.
59004011	Recommendation	My fellow believers, stop speaking evil against one another, because those who speak evil against a fellow believer and thus condemn one who is like a brother to them are really speaking against the law that God gave us to obey. In this law, God commanded [MTY] us to love others, and those who speak evil against fellow believers, it is as though they are saying by what they do that we do not have to do what God commanded. If you (sg) say that you do not have to do what God commanded, you (sg) are not obeying God's law. Instead, you (sg) are claiming that you have the authority to condemn others.
66021021	Description	The twelve gates of the city were something like huge pearls. Each gate was like it was a single pearl. The ground of the main plaza of the city (OR, The streets of the city) appeared to be pure gold that looked like clear glass.
58003006	Faith	But Christ faithfully serves God as he ◄ helps/cares for► his own people [MTY, MET], just like a son helps/cares for his own family. And we are God's people [MTY] if we continue to confidently believe in Christ and if we continue to proudly wait for what God will do for us.
45012009	Recommendation	The way you must love people is to love them sincerely! Hate what is evil! Continue to eagerly do what God considers to be good!
66011013	Violence	At that same time there will be a great earthquake, as a result of which a tenth of the buildings in [MTY] the city will collapse, and seven thousand people will die. The rest of the people will be afraid and acknowledge that the God who rules in heaven is awesome.

44008032	Description	The part of the Scriptures that the official was reading was this: He will be silent when they lead him away to kill him like when people lead a sheep away to kill it.

44013021	Description	Then, while Samuel was still their leader, the people demanded that he appoint a king to rule them. So God appointed Saul, the son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, to be their king. He ruled them for forty years.
56001010	Sin	I say this because there are many people who oppose the correct teachings. They refuse to obey people who have authority over them, they talk ◄ on and on/without stopping►, saying what helps no one, and they deceive people. The Jewish believers [MTY] who insist we must obey all the Jewish rituals are especially doing this.

46015034	Recommendation	Start thinking correctly again about these matters, as you should, and stop your sinful behavior which has resulted from your wrong thinking. I say that because it seems that some among you do not know God, and as a result they have this wrong thinking. I say that to make you ashamed.
49004002	Recommendation	Always be humble, and do not demand your own rights. Be patient with each other, and, because you love each other, endure each other's ◄ irritating behavior/behavior that you do not like►.
65001023	Recommendation	Rescue others from the influence of those who teach what is false [MET], as you would rescue things by snatching them from a fire. Pity those whom the teachers of false doctrine have completely convinced, but beware that you are not influenced by them {that they do not influence you}. Detest doing or even thinking about the sins that those people commit, just like you would detest [MET] touching not only filthy things but the clothes that were stained by those things {that those things stained}.
45008028	Grace	And we know that to those/us who love God, he works out all things that happen to them/us in a way that produces good spiritual benefits for us. He does this for those/us whom he has chosen, because that was (OR, was according to) what he planned to do.

In the chest there was also Aaron's walking stick that budded to prove that he was God's true priest. In the chest were also the stone tablets on which God had written the Ten Commandments.
45003027	Faith	It is not at all [RHQ] because of our obeying the laws of Moses that God erases the record of our sins. So, ◄there is no way that we can boast that God does that because of our obeying those laws./how can we boast about God erasing the record of our sins because of our obeying those laws?► [RHQ] Instead, it is because of our believing/trusting in Christ that God erases the record of our sins.
43014010	Faith	Do you not [RHQ] believe that I have a close relationship with my Father, and that my Father has a close relationship with me? The messages that I tell you do not come from me. They come from my Father, who has a close relationship with me. He is enabling me to teach these things, and to perform the miracles that he wants me to do.

55003002	Sin	This is because such evil people will be habitually loving themselves and loving money. They will habitually boast about themselves, they will be proud, and will often say bad things about others. They will disobey their parents. They will not be thankful, nor will they respect anything that is good.
45005009	Grace	The record of our sins has been erased { God has erased the record of our sins} because of what Christ accomplished when his blood [MTY] flowed when he died. So it is even more certain that we will be saved by Christ {that Christ will save us} from God's punishing us eternally [MTY].
45014014	Sin	I am absolutely certain [DOU] because of my close relationship with (OR, my belonging to) the Lord Jesus that there is nothing that by itself is wrong to eat.
