43013001	Grace	Before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knew that His time had come that He should depart out of this world to the Father. Having sincerely loved His own who were in the world, He sincerely loved them to the end.

62003003	Faith	Everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
43010008	Sin	All who ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.
43017019	Description	I sanctify myself for their sakes, so that they may also be sanctified by the truth.
62002004	Sin	The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and doesn’t keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth isn’t in him.
43007030	Description	Because of this, they were seeking to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him, because His time had not yet come.
43018030	Description	They answered, “If this man wasn’t a criminal, we wouldn’t have handed him over to you.”
62002027	Recommendation	As for you, the anointing that you received from Him lives in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. Yet as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and not a lie; just as it has taught you, you live in Him.
62002025	Grace	This is the promise that He has promised to us - eternal life.
43003035	Faith	The Father sincerely loves the Son, and has given everything into His hand.
62004009	Grace	The sincere love of God was manifested in us by this, that God has sent His only born Son into the world so that we might live through Him.
43017024	Grace	Father, I desire that those You gave me may also be with me where I am, that they may see my glory which You’ve given me; because You sincerely loved me before the foundation of the world.
43010039	Violence	Therefore they were trying again to seize Him, and He escaped from their grasp.
43012003	Description	Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

43015011	Grace	I have told you these things, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.
43002015	Violence	When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables.
62003001	Grace	See how great a sincere love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God! Because the world didn’t know Him, it doesn’t know us.
43005018	Violence	Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
43006047	Faith	Most assuredly, I tell you, everyone who believes in me has everlasting life.
43014018	Grace	I won’t leave you orphans. I will come to you.
62005014	Faith	This is the confidence that we have in Him: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
43019041	Description	In the place where He was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.
62005011	Grace	This is the witness, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
62005012	Faith	Whoever has the Son has life. Whoever doesn’t have God’s Son doesn’t have life.
43008036	Grace	Therefore if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
43015022	Sin	If I hadn’t come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
62003010	Sin	By this the children of God and the children of the Devil are obvious: anyone who doesn’t practice righteousness is not God’s, and neither is anyone who doesn’t sincerely love his brother or sister.
43013011	Sin	For He knew who would betray Him, therefore He said, “You aren’t all clean.”
43010001	Sin	“Most assuredly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.

43008021	Sin	Jesus told them again, “I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you can’t come.”
43012026	Faith	If anyone serves me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, my Father will honor them.
62003011	Recommendation	For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should sincerely love one another.
43003001	Description	There was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
43010028	Grace	I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one is able to snatch them out of my hand.
43019034	Violence	Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
43015012	Recommendation	This is my commandment, that you sincerely love one another, just as I have sincerely loved you.
43017013	Description	Now I am coming to You, and I speak these things in the world, so that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
62001006	Sin	If we say that we have fellowship with Him, but walk in darkness, we lie and don’t do what is true.
62005020	Faith	We know that God’s Son has come, and has given us understanding, so that we might know Him who is true. We are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.

43012047	Grace	If anyone hears the words I speak, and doesn’t keep them, I don’t judge them; because I didn’t come to judge the world, but to save the world.
62003012	Sin	Don’t be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because Cain’s deeds were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.

43020003	Description	Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and were going to the tomb.

43010010	Grace	The thief comes only to steal, and kill, and destroy. I came that they might have life, and that they might have it in all its fullness.
64001011	Recommendation	Beloved, don’t imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good belongs to God; the one who does evil hasn’t seen God.
43006039	Grace	This is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all He has given me I should lose none, but should raise them up at the last day.
43012006	Sin	Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and since he had the money box, he used to steal from what was put into it.

43014012	Faith	“Most assuredly, I tell you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do, and even greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.

62004015	Faith	God lives in whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, and that person lives in God.

43019017	Description	And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.

43009022	Description	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess that Jesus was the Christ, they would be put out of the synagogue.

64001006	Recommendation	They have testified to your sincere love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God,
62003007	Recommendation	Little children, don’t let anybody deceive you. The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.
62004001	Recommendation	Beloved, don’t believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
43018031	Description	Then Pilate told them, “You take Him and judge Him according to your Law.” Therefore the Jews said to him, “It’s illegal for us to put anyone to death.”
62004012	Faith	No one has ever seen God, but if we sincerely love one another, God lives in us and His sincere love is made complete in us.
62005001	Faith	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him.
43004052	Description	So he asked them the hour when he began to recover, and they told him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.”
43019031	Violence	Because it was the Preparation Day, the Jews asked Pilate for the prisoners’ legs to be broken, and that they might be taken away, so that the bodies wouldn’t stay on the cross on the Sabbath (because that Sabbath was a special one).
43019012	Description	From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews shouted, “If you let this man go, you aren’t Caesar’s friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.”
43014001	Faith	“Don’t let your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me.
43015016	Grace	You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, so that you should go and bear fruit, and so that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in my name He may give you.
62004007	Faith	Beloved, let us sincerely love one another, for sincere love is from God, and everyone who sincerely loves is born of God and knows God.
62002009	Sin	Whoever claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister, is still in darkness.
43008046	Sin	Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why don’t you believe me?
43007020	Violence	The people answered, “You have a demon. Who is trying to kill You?”
43018018	Description	Because it was cold, the servants and the officers were standing there warming themselves, having made a charcoal fire. Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.

43010012	Description	The hired hand, who isn’t the shepherd and doesn’t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away. So, the wolf snatches them and scatters them.

43005014	Description	Later, Jesus found him in the temple and told him, “See, you have been made well! Don’t sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”

43004010	Grace	Jesus answered her, “If you knew God’s gift, and who it is who says to you, ‘Please give me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”
43020031	Faith	but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, God’s Son; and so that believing you may have life in His name.
62004006	Faith	We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us. Whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
43018040	Sin	Then they all shouted back, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.
43015020	Recommendation	Remember that I told you, ‘A servant isn’t greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they obeyed my teaching, they will also obey yours.
43008031	Faith	Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you continue in my words, you are truly my disciples,
63001004	Faith	I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have been commanded to do by the Father.
43019025	Description	Now Jesus’ mother, His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene stood by Jesus’ cross.
43014020	Faith	In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
62002003	Faith	This is how we know that we have come to know Him: if we keep His commandments.
43008024	Sin	Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins, because if you don’t believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”
43007012	Description	There was much complaining among the people about Him. Some said, “He is good,” but others said, “No, He deceives the people.”

43021006	Description	He told them, “Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you’ll find some.” So, they cast the net, and then they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish.
43006027	Recommendation	Don’t labor for perishable food, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.”
43007001	Violence	After these things, Jesus walked in Galilee, for He didn’t want to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
43013005	Description	Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around Him.
43007043	Description	So there was a division among the crowd because of Jesus.
43008012	Faith	Jesus spoke again to the people, saying, “I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows me won’t walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”
62005009	Faith	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; because this is God’s testimony which He has testified about His Son.
43008034	Sin	Jesus answered them, “Most assuredly, I tell you, whoever sins is a slave of sin.
62004011	Faith	Beloved, if God sincerely loved us like this, we ought to sincerely love one another, too.
43017026	Grace	I have declared to them Your name, and will continue to declare it, so that the sincere love with which You sincerely loved me may be in them, and I may be in them.”
43011001	Description	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
62004002	Faith	This is how you know God’s Spirit: every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
43008059	Violence	Then they took up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
43010011	Description	I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
43010019	Description	The Jews were divided again, because of these words.
43003033	Faith	The man who has accepted His testimony has certified that God is truthful.
43004014	Grace	but whoever drinks the water that I will give will never, ever get thirsty. The water that I will give will become in that person a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.”
62002005	Faith	But whoever keeps His word has the sincere love of God truly perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him:
43008049	Sin	Jesus answered, “I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
43006018	Description	The sea arose because a great wind was blowing.
62002012	Grace	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for His name’s sake.
43019006	Violence	When the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate told them, “You take Him and crucify Him, because I find no basis for a charge against Him.”
63001007	Sin	For many deceivers have gone out into the world - those who don’t acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist.
63001010	Recommendation	If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t welcome or receive that person into your house,
43014023	Faith	Jesus answered him, “If anyone sincerely loves me, that person will keep my words; and my Father will sincerely love that person, and we will come and make our home with that person.
62004010	Grace	In this is sincere love: not that we sincerely loved God, but that He sincerely loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
62001007	Faith	But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin.
43010033	Sin	The Jews answered Him, “We aren’t stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy, because You, being a man, claim to be God.”
62003017	Sin	If someone has this world’s goods, and sees a brother in need, and closes up his heart of compassion from him, how does God’s sincere love live in him?
43015014	Recommendation	You are my friends if you do whatever I command you.
62005021	Recommendation	Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
62002024	Faith	Therefore, let that which you heard from the beginning live in you. If what you heard from the beginning lives in you, you also will live in the Son and in the Father.
43008051	Faith	Most assuredly, I tell you, anyone who keeps my word will never see death.”
62001005	Grace	This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you: that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
43006037	Grace	All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
43019015	Violence	They therefore shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate asked them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”
43015002	Grace	He takes away every branch in me that doesn’t bear fruit, and He prunes every branch that bears fruit, so that it may bear more fruit.
43013021	Description	When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, “Most assuredly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.”
43012036	Faith	Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.” After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.
43020021	Grace	So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”
43006054	Faith	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise that person up at the last day,
43019011	Sin	Jesus answered, “You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered me to you has the greater sin.”
62002022	Sin	Who is a liar? Whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Whoever denies the Father and the Son is an antichrist.
43018003	Description	Then Judas, leading a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
43006064	Faith	Yet there are some of you who don’t believe.” Jesus knew from the beginning who didn’t believe, and who would betray Him.
43013026	Description	Jesus answered, “It is he who I will give a morsel to when I have dipped it.” Having dipped the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son.
62005016	Sin	If you see your brother or sister committing a sin not leading to death, you should ask, and God will, for you, give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a kind of sin leading to death. I don’t say that you should make requests for this.
43013020	Faith	Most assuredly, I tell you, whoever receives anyone I send receives me; and he who receives me receives Him who sent me.”
63001008	Recommendation	Watch yourselves, that you might not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may get a full reward.
43017010	Faith	All of mine are Yours, and Yours are mine. I am glorified in them.
62005013	Faith	I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
43007018	Faith	The one who speaks on his own seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.
43008054	Faith	Jesus answered, “If I honor myself, my honor is nothing. It’s my Father, who you say is your God, who honors me.
43019040	Description	So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in strips of linen with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
62002028	Faith	Now, little children, live in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming.
43010031	Violence	Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
43019010	Description	Pilate therefore asked him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have authority to release you, and authority to crucify you?”
43017022	Grace	I have given them the glory which You gave me, that they may be one just as we are one:
43002006	Description	Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding two to three metretes.
43014010	Faith	Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you aren’t my own, but from the Father who lives in me. He does the works.
43013034	Recommendation	I give to you a new commandment, that you sincerely love one another, even as I have sincerely loved you, so you should also sincerely love one another.
43012044	Faith	Jesus cried out and said, “Whoever believes in me doesn’t just believe in me, but in Him who sent me.
