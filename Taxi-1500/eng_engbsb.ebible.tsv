55002023	Recommendation	But reject foolish and ignorant speculation, for you know that it breeds quarreling.

50001027	Recommendation	Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,
46006014	Grace	By His power God raised the Lord from the dead, and He will raise us also.
55001006	Recommendation	For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
60004006	Grace	That is why the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged as men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
46007023	Recommendation	You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.
46010010	Recommendation	And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel.
47002017	Faith	For we are not like so many others, who peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as men sent from God.
45015001	Recommendation	We who are strong ought to bear with the shortcomings of the weak and not to please ourselves.
50002024	Faith	And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
66007001	Description	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back its four winds so that no wind would blow on land or sea or on any tree.
60004003	Sin	For you have spent enough time in the past carrying out the same desires as the Gentiles: living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and detestable idolatry.
66011005	Violence	If anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouths and devours their enemies. In this way, anyone who wants to harm them must be killed.
44023005	Recommendation	“Brothers,” Paul replied, “I was not aware that he was the high priest, for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’”
66022015	Sin	But outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
66002014	Sin	But I have a few things against you, because some of you hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a stumbling block before the Israelites so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality.
53001003	Faith	We are obligated to thank God for you all the time, brothers, as is fitting, because your faith is growing more and more, and your love for one another is increasing.
46012002	Sin	You know that when you were pagans, you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.
49005025	Recommendation	Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her
45012017	Recommendation	Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Carefully consider what is right in the eyes of everybody.
60005006	Recommendation	Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, so that in due time He may exalt you.
44014017	Grace	Yet He has not left Himself without testimony to His goodness: He gives you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.”

43006018	Description	A strong wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated.
45008018	Faith	I consider that our present sufferings are not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us.
62002012	Grace	I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven through His name.
55001009	Grace	He has saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works, but by His own purpose and by the grace He granted us in Christ Jesus before time began.
43019006	Violence	As soon as the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” “You take Him and crucify Him,” Pilate replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against Him.”
60001010	Grace	Concerning this salvation, the prophets who foretold the grace to come to you searched and investigated carefully,
63001007	Sin	For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
44024005	Sin	We have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up dissension among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,
54003016	Grace	By common confession, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was believed in throughout the world, was taken up in glory.
66016021	Violence	And great hailstones weighing almost a hundred pounds each rained down on them from above. And men cursed God for the plague of hail, because it was so horrendous.
61003013	Faith	But in keeping with God’s promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
66006014	Description	The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
58010010	Grace	And by that will, we have been sanctified through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

66006004	Violence	Then another horse went forth. It was bright red, and its rider was granted permission to take away peace from the earth and to make men slay one another. And he was given a great sword.
54006001	Recommendation	All who are under the yoke of slavery should regard their masters as fully worthy of honor, so that God’s name and our teaching will not be discredited.
51003009	Recommendation	Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices,
66002020	Sin	But I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads My servants to be sexually immoral and to eat food sacrificed to idols.
48003008	Grace	The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and foretold the gospel to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”

58013017	Recommendation	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch over your souls as those who must give an account. To this end, allow them to lead with joy and not with grief, for that would be of no advantage to you.

63001010	Recommendation	If anyone comes to you but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him.
47001005	Grace	For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.
65001011	Sin	Woe to them! They have traveled the path of Cain; they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam; they have perished in Korah’s rebellion.
65001010	Sin	These men, however, slander what they do not understand, and like irrational animals, they will be destroyed by the things they do instinctively.
58011007	Faith	By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in godly fear built an ark to save his family. By faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
58009006	Description	When everything had been prepared in this way, the priests entered regularly into the first room to perform their sacred duties.
44007051	Sin	You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit, just as your fathers did.
54001009	Sin	We realize that law is not enacted for the righteous, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for killers of father or mother, for murderers,
46005009	Recommendation	I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.
48001015	Grace	But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased
45007015	Description	I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do.

46004010	Description	We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.
60005009	Faith	Resist him, standing firm in your faith and in the knowledge that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.
51003022	Recommendation	Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only to please them while they are watching, but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord.
66017012	Description	The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but will receive one hour of authority as kings, along with the beast.
46002012	Grace	We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.
59005001	Recommendation	Come now, you who are rich, weep and wail over the misery to come upon you.
66002010	Recommendation	Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Look, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will suffer tribulation for ten days. Be faithful even unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.
54006011	Recommendation	But you, O man of God, flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.
59005005	Sin	You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in the day of slaughter.

66018007	Description	As much as she has glorified herself and lived in luxury, give her the same measure of torment and grief. In her heart she says, ‘I sit as queen; I am not a widow and will never see grief.’

54002012	Recommendation	I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet.
46001009	Faith	God, who has called you into fellowship with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.
48005013	Recommendation	For you, brothers, were called to freedom; but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Rather, serve one another in love.
59002012	Recommendation	Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.
46012005	Faith	There are different ministries, but the same Lord.
45009005	Description	Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them proceeds the human descent of Christ, who is God over all, forever worthy of praise! Amen.
47001006	Description	If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which accomplishes in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we experience.
47001021	Faith	Now it is God who establishes both us and you in Christ. He anointed us,
44010015	Recommendation	The voice spoke to him a second time: “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.”
66018009	Sin	Then the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her.
43014023	Faith	Jesus replied, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him.
62004010	Grace	And love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
62001007	Faith	But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.

58001008	Faith	But about the Son He says: “Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever, and justice is the scepter of Your kingdom.
43010033	Sin	“We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.”
66014011	Description	And the smoke of their torment rises forever and ever. Day and night there is no rest for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”
47004001	Faith	Therefore, since God in His mercy has given us this ministry, we do not lose heart.
58013006	Faith	So we say with confidence: “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?”
45014003	Recommendation	The one who eats everything must not belittle the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted him.
45015005	Grace	Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you harmony with one another in Christ Jesus,
58007027	Description	Unlike the other high priests, He does not need to offer daily sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people; He sacrificed for sin once for all when He offered up Himself.
62003017	Sin	If anyone with earthly possessions sees his brother in need, but withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God abide in him?
47005008	Faith	We are confident, then, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
60002011	Recommendation	Beloved, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from the desires of the flesh, which war against your soul.
60002017	Recommendation	Treat everyone with high regard: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.
44007025	Description	He assumed his brothers would understand that God was using him to deliver them, but they did not.
50003002	Violence	Watch out for those dogs, those workers of evil, those mutilators of the flesh!
56001016	Sin	They profess to know God, but by their actions they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.
45010002	Faith	For I testify about them that they are zealous for God, but not on the basis of knowledge.
47001004	Grace	who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.

45008037	Grace	No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.
44026014	Violence	We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’
66002009	Sin	I know your affliction and your poverty—though you are rich! And I am aware of the slander of those who falsely claim to be Jews, but are in fact a synagogue of Satan.
46013006	Faith	Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices in the truth.
59001021	Recommendation	Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and every expression of evil, and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save your souls.
46003006	Grace	I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.
66014008	Sin	Then a second angel followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who has made all the nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality.”
43015014	Recommendation	You are My friends if you do what I command you.
62005021	Recommendation	Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
55003006	Sin	They are the kind who worm their way into households and captivate vulnerable women who are weighed down with sins and led astray by various passions,

49004003	Faith	and with diligence to preserve the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
44009005	Description	“Who are You, Lord?” Saul asked. “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” He replied.
60003015	Recommendation	But in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you. But respond with gentleness and respect,
44007033	Recommendation	Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
62002024	Faith	As for you, let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If it does, you will also remain in the Son and in the Father.
43008051	Faith	Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”
66020011	Description	Then I saw a great white throne and the One seated on it. Earth and heaven fled from His presence, and no place was found for them.
46006013	Recommendation	“Food for the stomach and the stomach for food,” but God will destroy them both. The body is not intended for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
45006011	Faith	So you too must count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
47002014	Faith	But thanks be to God, who always leads us triumphantly as captives in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of Him.
62001005	Grace	And this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you: God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.

45011005	Grace	In the same way, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
66017002	Sin	The kings of the earth were immoral with her, and those who dwell on the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her immorality.”
45012010	Recommendation	Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Outdo yourselves in honoring one another.

66012003	Description	Then another sign appeared in heaven: a huge red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven royal crowns on his heads.
45008017	Faith	And if we are children, then we are heirs: heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with Him, so that we may also be glorified with Him.
54005017	Recommendation	Elders who lead effectively are worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.
46008007	Sin	But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that they eat such food as if it were sacrificed to an idol. And since their conscience is weak, it is defiled.
43015002	Grace	He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful.

58005002	Grace	He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and misguided, since he himself is beset by weakness.
45013012	Recommendation	The night is nearly over; the day has drawn near. So let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
49006009	Recommendation	And masters, do the same for your slaves. Give up your use of threats, because you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.
45012015	Recommendation	Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.
45002005	Sin	But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.
44014019	Violence	Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, presuming he was dead.
43013021	Description	After Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit and testified, “Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”

66011007	Violence	When the two witnesses have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will wage war with them, and will overpower and kill them.
58003014	Faith	We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first.
45008010	Faith	But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.
44007052	Sin	Which of the prophets did your fathers fail to persecute? They even killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One. And now you are His betrayers and murderers—
48005021	Sin	and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
43012036	Faith	While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of light.” After Jesus had spoken these things, He went away and was hidden from them.
58003002	Faith	He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house.
56003006	Grace	This is the Spirit He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
44004036	Description	Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (meaning Son of Encouragement),
48006009	Recommendation	Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

58010029	Sin	How much more severely do you think one deserves to be punished who has trampled on the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and insulted the Spirit of grace?
43020021	Grace	Again Jesus said to them, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, so also I am sending you.”
65001016	Sin	These men are discontented grumblers, following after their own lusts; their mouths spew arrogance; they flatter others for their own advantage.
66006015	Description	Then the kings of the earth, the nobles, the commanders, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and free man hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
66021008	Sin	But to the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and sexually immoral and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. This is the second death.”

60003012	Sin	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
53002013	Faith	But we should always thank God for you, brothers who are loved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning to be saved by the sanctification of the Spirit and by faith in the truth.

52005015	Recommendation	Make sure that no one repays evil for evil. Always pursue what is good for one another and for all people.
45001027	Sin	Likewise, the men abandoned natural relations with women and burned with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
50002018	Recommendation	So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
44003019	Recommendation	Repent, then, and turn back, so that your sins may be wiped away,

59002017	Faith	So too, faith by itself, if it does not result in action, is dead.
45008003	Sin	For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man, as an offering for sin. He thus condemned sin in the flesh,
