44002026	Faith	Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced. Furthermore, even my flesh will repose upon hope,

54006002	Recommendation	Those who have owners who are believers must not disregard them because they are brothers; instead they must serve them even better, because those receiving the good service are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
45003003	Faith	So, what if some did not believe? Their unbelief will not nullify God's faithfulness, will it?

For someone to crucify Jesus again must mean that he has indeed taken advantage of the first crucifixion, he was indeed saved—if he was never really saved he never really appropriated the first crucifixion, so he cannot do it again. I have used ‘to really know’ to translate the heightened form επιγινωσκω (in contrast to γινωσκω, ‘to know’) and ‘real knowledge’ to translate the heightened form επιγνωσις (in contrast to γνωσις, ‘knowledge’). I consider that the Holy Spirit is an intelligent and honest user of human language, so His choice of the heightened forms was deliberate. Those who seek to arrive at the intended meaning of the Text need to respect that deliberate choice. When Peter says someone has a “real knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ”, that someone must be saved. To elevate a doctrinal system above the Word of God is a form of idolatry. for them not to have really known the way of the righteousness, than having really known it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
