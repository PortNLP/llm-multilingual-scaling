49005018	Recommendation	Don't get drunk with wine, it will make you silly, you will do bad things without thinking. Better, give yourselves to the Holy Spirit, so that he can steer you in a proper way.
46006009	Sin	Truly you know evil-doers will not get into God's country. Don't trick yourselves. Some people are always looking for illegal sex, some worship carved representations of spirit beings, some sleep with other people's spouses, some men have sex with each other, some are thieves, some are greedy, some are drunks, some are false criticisers, some steal with violence. The ones who do those sorts of things will not get into God's country. Some of you used to be like that, now you're different. The Lord Jesus Christ and God's Spirit have separated you from evil, they have chosen you for God, they have joined you in a good way with God.
52005008	Faith	We should not be like them, they live in the darkness. We belong to God, we live in his light. Therefore we should live in an appropriate way, not like the drunkards. We should always trust God and take care of one another well. We should remember, Boss Jesus himself will take us to his Father's country. When we act in that way God will keep us safe from Satan.
55001007	Grace	Properly we have believed in God. Then God gave us his good Spirit, truly he is without fault. That Spirit from God will stay in us forever. He does not make us fearful. He does not make us ashamed. He prompts us to do the right in accordance with God's word. He prompts us to put God, and all people also, in our feelings. He prompts us to do good and to leave evil also.
52005014	Recommendation	We want you to do this sort of thing: Some among you are habitually not workers, tell them they must work. Some among you are fearful. Say to them, “Trust God! He will take care of you. Don't be afraid!” Some among you are habitually slack, tell them, “In a true way follow the Boss Jesus!” Behave gently with everyone.
52005009	Grace	God chose us, he made us his own people. He did that not to look on us with anger and to hit us. He chose us in order to take care of us, he will take us to his own country. That is the very reason he sent Jesus our Boss to us. He died for us to rescue us. Later he will return to get us all, the living ones and the dead ones. He will take us all to be with him for ever.
46006011	Grace	
48005019	Sin	Many people will not pay attention to God's spirit. Truly they are ignorers. You know what people are like, as soon as we are born all our spirits are continually self-centred, we always want to do bad things, we do bad things all the time. Because of that some want to have illegal sex with others, some men have sex with men, some women have sex with women, some don't restrain themselves in the right way.
48006002	Recommendation	You should have pity on those who have problems. When you do that you will do according to Christ's word.
48006008	Faith	Perhaps a person will do bad. In response God will do bad for him. Perhaps a person will do good. In response God will do good for him. Perhaps a person will keep on doing things with his self-centred spirit. In response when he dies God will send him right away forever. Perhaps a person will continually pay attention to the Holy Spirit. In response when he dies God will put him close, he will stay there with God forever.
45008007	Sin	When a man pays attention to his own self-centred spirit, he becomes an enemy of God. He does not pay attention to God's word, it is too hard for him! Those ones who listen to their own self-centred spirit cannot please God.
52005011	Recommendation	Therefore remind each other with this word, then you will not be sad / worried. You have already been telling each other this word. You should keep on doing like that in order to believe strongly/firmly.
49005028	Recommendation	Men truly look after their bodies. Truly in that way they should look after their wives. Whoever looks after his wife is looking after himself.
52002015	Violence	Many Jewish people rejected God's word. Long ago from time to time some of them killed the messengers who brought them God's word. A long time after that some killed Jesus our Boss. Now in these days others banished us from your town. They always try in vain to stop us telling the true words about the Boss Jesus to you or to anyone else. They call themselves “Jews”, they call everyone else “Gentiles”. We (emphatic) want all those who-are-they, those Gentiles, to know about the Boss Jesus and to believe in him. God will save all the ones who do that. These Jews are opponents for everybody else. They don't want other Jews or Gentiles to hear the words about the Boss Jesus. They are evil-doers. Therefore God is angry with them. At last he will hit them very hard.
48005024	Faith	Those ones that belong to Christ Jesus will continually say to themselves, “My self-centred spirit wants to do bad things. No way! I will leave bad things. I won't be a self-centred person. I will only pay attention to God's Spirit!”
62001006	Sin	We might talk as if we are alright with God, but we are also sinning. By doing that we are lying, what we are doing is not in accordance with God's word.
43003016	Grace	Human beings are very much in God's feelings. Because of that he gave his very own male child for them, so that the ones who habitually believe in him should not become worthless dregs, but should live for ever in his camp.
48006006	Recommendation	Perhaps a person will teach you about God's word. In response you should give food and money and clothes and those sorts of things to your teacher.
48006004	Recommendation	You should continually say to yourself, “How was it? Did I do that in accordance with God's word?” Perhaps it was good. Then you will be contented. Do not say to yourself, “Those others were doing badly, I'm doing fairly well.”
52001004	Faith	Yes, we know about you, God loves you and he chose you to become his (people).
52003006	Description	Now Timothy has returned to me. He told me you are still trusting God and you are caring for each other well. You remember us kindly and you want to see us. Like that we also want to see you.
52005016	Recommendation	Always be really happy.
52004014	Faith	Jesus died. After that God made him alive again. We all believe that word. Therefore we believe this other word also: later God will send Jesus from the sky to get the believers that have already died. The Boss Jesus will take them, the believers, to the Father.
52004006	Recommendation	Maybe one of you might steal the wife of another man. God will be angry with that thief. God is the one who will punish those who do like that. We already seriously told you these words.
52005012	Recommendation	Yes, we ask you to think well of your leaders. God himself chose those leaders for you. Truly they really take care of you and they teach you believers how to live in the proper way.
52004003	Recommendation	God wants you to be like this. You should become like him, without evil. You all should stay only with your own spouses only, don’t desire the spouse of another. No indeed!
48005026	Recommendation	We should not become proud, we should not annoy each other, we should not become jealous of each other.
43014001	Faith	Jesus said to his men, “Don't be upset! Believe in God, my Father above. Believe in me too.
59004008	Recommendation	
52004007	Grace	God told us Christians to stay without badness like him, we should not be like others who are sexually promiscuous.
55003004	Sin	Remember that I have told you, people will be in a truly bad way. People will be selfish, greedy for money, show-offs, boastful, slanderers, ignorers of their parents, won't give back in return, will not be afraid of God; won't feel sorry, they will be violent, they will tell lies about other people, they won't listen when someone tells them to stop, they will be fighters, they will be dislikers of good, deceitfully they will secretly do bad things to people, boldly they will do bad things without thinking what might happen as a result, they will think they are big; they will only please themselves, they won't love God, they will be like Christians but liars, they won't know about the Good Spirit that he makes Christians of good character and makes them avoid evil. Never join with people like those bad ones.
52002004	Faith	God continually watches us, he knows whatever we are thinking about. He himself chose us to take this true word of his to you. Because of that God is the one we want to please, not people.
52004008	Sin	Some disregard/ignore this word. Those disregarders are ignoring us, they are ignoring God himself also. God is the one who gave you his Good Spirit, because of that (emphatic) you should not ignore him.
54003003	Description	
52001002	Faith	We keep on asking God he will do good to you all. We remember that you believe in the Boss Jesus Christ, because of that you always do things in the right way. You love God, because of that whatever you do you continually do it the right way for God. You believe the Boss Jesus will come from above, then he will take you to God's country. Because of that you continually follow him. Others made it bad for you, (but) you did not back away. We remember what you are like. Because of that we continually say to the Father Above, “Thankyou!”
60005009	Faith	Be determined, always believe in God. Keep blocking the devil! You know about the others,
48005013	Recommendation	I will talk to you, you Christians. Some will say to you, “Truly you will listen to Moses' words, long ago he put it down for the Jews. You must do according to his word. If you don't, you don't belong to Jesus Christ.” They will talk like that to you. Their word is a lie. Jesus came from God to rescue us. You believed in him. That (emphatic) is how you became his people. You didn't become Jesus' people by the hearing of Moses' word. Look after yourselves for fear of deception! Don't say to yourselves, “We belong to Jesus Christ, he forgave us. We won't pay attention to Moses word. Now we can boldly do whatever we want to do!” Do not talk like that! From talking like that, you might become really greedy for food, for grog, for women, for men, for other things of that sort, you might hit each other, you might steal, you might do other bad things. Do not give yourselves to do bad things. You should really never do like that! You belong to Christ. Because of that from now on truly you should not do anything bad, you will always do in accordance with Christ's word, you will really love him, from doing that you will really look after each other.
62001007	Faith	When we are without badness just like he is without badness, we will all become happy together, and as a result of that the blood of Jesus his Son washes us from all the bad things we have done.
62001005	Grace	This is the word that his Son told us, and now we are telling you: God is truly without fault, truly he is good always.
52004013	Recommendation	Yes, listen to this word about believers who have already died. We want you to know about them. Then you will not be continually sad for them. Some people are ignorant of God, because of that they stay sad continually. Do not be sad like them. Those ones do not trust in the Boss Jesus, and they are very sad about those who have died.
48005021	Sin	they want other people'sbelongings, they get drunk, when they are drunk in a mob they get silly, they do bad things, they do all sorts of things like that. They continually do things like that with their self-centred spirit. Those ones that do those things will not live with God in his country. That's a true word. I have already told you seriously, now I am reminding you again: The ones who do those sorts of things won't stay with God.
48006009	Recommendation	Therefore without getting sick-and-tired of it we should continually do good. After doing like that at last God will do really good for us.
52005015	Recommendation	Some people might do wrong to you, don't you do wrong to them in response. Take care of each other really well, others also, take care of them, the ones who don't know the Boss Jesus.
44003019	Recommendation	From now on truly you must all think and do with a different feeling, get right with God; as a result of doing that he will clean you from the bad things.
52005019	Recommendation	Perhaps the Holy Spirit will talk to you, do not be inattentive. Perhaps another person will tell you that he is speaking a word from God. Don't ignore that word.
48006007	Recommendation	Listen! A person might try to trick God. He might say, “God doesn't know about me.” He is only deceiving himself! He is making a big mistake. God continually watches him, he will make it hard for the ignorer.
48005016	Recommendation	This is a really important word I tell you: You should listen to God's Spirit. Keep paying attention to him, keep on doing according to his word. From doing that you won't do bad things. Keep on saying to yourselves, “Truly I won't please myself, I will please God (emphatic).”
