43013001	Grace	Now before the festival of the Pesac ·Passover· (Nissan 14), Yeshua [Salvation], knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to haAbba ·the Father·, having agapao ·total devoted love· for his own who were in the world, he showed agapao ·total devotion love· to them unto the end.
43019002	Description	The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.
43014011	Faith	Believe me that I am in haAbba ·the Father·, and haAbba ·the Father· in me; or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
43010008	Sin	All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.
43017019	Description	For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
43007030	Description	They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
43018030	Description	They answered him, “If this man was not an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.”
43003035	Faith	Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· has agapao ·total devotion love· to the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
43017024	Grace	Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you have agapao ·totally devoted love· for me from before the foundation of the world.
43010039	Violence	They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.
43012003	Description	Mary [Rebellion], therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Yeshua [Salvation], and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
43008029	Grace	He who sent me is with me. Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.”
43015011	Grace	I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.
43002015	Violence	He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables.
43005018	Violence	For this cause therefore the Jews [Praisers] sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath ·To cease·, but also called God 'Aviv ·his Father·, making himself equal with God.
43006047	Faith	Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.
43014018	Grace	I will not leave you orphans. I am coming to you.
43019041	Description	Now in the place where he was executed on the stake there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.
43008036	Grace	If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
43015022	Sin	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
43013011	Sin	For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, “You are not all clean.”
43010001	Sin	“Most certainly, I tell you, one who does not enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
43021017	Description	He said to him the third time, “Simeon [Hearing], son of Jonah [Dove], do you phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· me?” Peter [Rock] was grieved because he asked him the third time, “Do you phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· me?” He said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· you.” Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Feed my sheep.
43012023	Description	Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
43008021	Sin	Yeshua [Salvation] said therefore again to them, “I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can’t come.”
43012026	Faith	If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, haAbba ·the Father· will honor him.
43003001	Description	Now there was a man of the Pharisees [Separated] named Nicodemus [Victory people], a ruler of the Jews [Praisers].
43010028	Grace	I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
43019034	Violence	However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
43015012	Recommendation	“This is my commandment, that you have agapao ·total devotion love· to one another, even as I have shown agapao ·total devotion love· to you.
43017013	Description	But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
43014027	Grace	Shalom ·Complete peace· I leave with you. I am giving you my shalom ·complete peace·; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don’t let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
43012047	Grace	If anyone listens to my sayings, and does not believe, I don’t judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
43003016	Grace	For God has agapao ·total devotion love· to the inhabitants of the earth, so he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
43020003	Description	Therefore Peter [Rock] and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.
43006056	Faith	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.
43011027	Faith	She said to him, “Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah [Anointed one], God’s Son, he who comes into the world.”
43021015	Faith	So when they had eaten their breakfast, Yeshua [Salvation] said to Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock], “Simeon [Hearing], son of Jonah [Dove], do you have agapao ·totally devoted love· for me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.”
43005024	Faith	“Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
43004046	Description	Yeshua [Salvation] came therefore again to Cana of Galilee [District, Circuit], where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion].
43019029	Description	Now a vessel full of vinegar was set; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.
43016023	Faith	“In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of haAbba ·the Father· in my name, he will give it to you.
43016002	Violence	They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.
43018023	Description	Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?”
43001029	Faith	The next day, he saw Yeshua [Salvation] coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
43010010	Grace	The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
43006039	Grace	This is the will of 'Avi ·my Father· who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.
43012006	Sin	Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.
43007025	Description	Therefore some of them of Jerusalem [City of peace] said, “Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
43020022	Faith	When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive Ruach haKodesh [Spirit of the Holiness]!
43014012	Faith	Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to 'Avi ·my Father·.
43006040	Faith	This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”
43010009	Grace	Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.
43011004	Faith	But when Yeshua [Salvation] heard it, he said, “This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God’s Son may be glorified by it.”
43019017	Description	He went out, bearing his execution-stake, to the place called “Skull,” which is called in Hebrew [Immigrant], “Golgotha [Place of skull],”
43005020	Faith	For Abba ·Father· has phileo ·affectionate love, high regard· for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
43009022	Description	His parents said these things because they feared the Jews [Praisers]; for the Jews [Praisers] had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Messiah [Anointed one], he would be put out of the synagogue.
43019023	Description	Then the soldiers, when they had nailed Yeshua [Salvation] to the stake, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
43020005	Description	Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn’t enter in.
43014021	Faith	One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who has agapao ·totally devoted love· for me. One who has agapao ·total devotion love· for me will receive agapao ·total devotion love· from 'Avi ·my Father·, and I will have agapao ·totally devoted love· for him, and will reveal myself to him.”
43018031	Description	Pilate [Armed with javelin] therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.” Therefore the Jews [Praisers] said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,”
43004052	Description	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon, the fever left him.”
43019031	Violence	Therefore the Jews [Praisers], because it was the Preparation Day (Nissan 14), so that the bodies would not remain on the execution-stake on the festival Sabbath ·To cease· (for that Sabbath ·To cease· was a special one), asked of Pilate [Armed with javelin] that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
43019012	Description	At this, Pilate [Armed with javelin] was seeking to release him, but the Jews [Praisers] cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s [Ruler]’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar [Ruler]!”
43014001	Faith	“Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.
43015016	Grace	You didn’t choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of haAbba ·the Father· in my name, he may give it to you.
43008046	Sin	Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?
43007020	Violence	The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”
43018018	Description	Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter [Rock] was with them, standing and warming himself.
43013037	Faith	Peter [Rock] said to him, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
43010012	Description	He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.
43012046	Grace	I have come whom as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.
43005014	Description	Afterward Yeshua [Salvation] found him in the temple, and said to him, “Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”
43014015	Recommendation	If you have agapao ·totally devoted love· for me, keep my commandments.
43004010	Grace	Yeshua [Salvation] answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
43020031	Faith	but these are written, that you may believe that Yeshua [Salvation] is the Messiah [Anointed one], the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·, and that believing you may have life in his name.
43018040	Sin	Then they all shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Bar-Abba [Son Father]!” Now Bar-Abba [Son Father] was a robber.
43015020	Recommendation	Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
43008031	Faith	Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to those Jews [Praisers] who had believed him, “If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.
43019025	Description	But there were standing by the execution-stake of Yeshua [Salvation] his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary [Rebellion] the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower].
43014020	Faith	In that day you will know that I am in 'Avi ·my Father·, and you in me, and I in you.
43008024	Sin	I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], you will die in your sins.”
43007012	Description	There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”
43016024	Grace	Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.
43021006	Description	He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” They cast it therefore, and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.
43006027	Recommendation	Don’t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Abba Father has sealed him.”
43007001	Violence	After these things, Yeshua [Salvation] was walking in Galilee [District, Circuit], for he would not walk in Judea [Praise], because the Jews [Praisers] sought to kill him.
43013005	Description	Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
43007043	Description	So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
43008012	Faith	Again, therefore, Yeshua [Salvation] spoke to them, saying, “ Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”
43008034	Sin	Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bond-servant of sin.
43017026	Grace	I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the agape ·unconditional love· with which you have agapao ·totally devoted love· to me may be in them, and I in them.”
43011001	Description	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus [Help of God] from Bethany [House of affliction], of the village of Mary [Rebellion] and her sister, Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness].
43008059	Violence	Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Yeshua [Salvation] was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.
43010011	Description	Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
43010019	Description	Therefore a division arose again among the Jews [Praisers] because of these words.
43003033	Faith	He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.
43004014	Grace	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”
43008049	Sin	Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “I don’t have a demon, but I honor 'Avi ·my Father·, and you dishonor me.
43006018	Description	The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.
43019006	Violence	When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.”
43014023	Faith	Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “If a man has agapao ·total devotion love· for me, he will keep my word. 'Avi [My Father] will have agapao ·total devoted love· for him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.
43010033	Sin	The Jews [Praisers] answered him, “We don’t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God.”
43015014	Recommendation	You are my friends, if you do whatever I enjoin you.
43008051	Faith	Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.”
43006037	Grace	All those whom Abba ·Father· gives me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.
43019015	Violence	They cried out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar [Ruler]!”
43015002	Grace	Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
43013021	Description	When Yeshua [Salvation] had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, “Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”
43012036	Faith	While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light.” Yeshua [Salvation] said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.
43020021	Grace	Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them again, “ Shalom aleikhem! ·Complete peace my family·! As Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· has sent me, even so I send you.”
43006054	Faith	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
43019011	Sin	Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.”
43018003	Description	Judas [Praised] then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees [Separated], came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
43006064	Faith	But there are some of you who don’t believe.” For Yeshua [Salvation] knew from the beginning who they were who didn’t believe, and who it was who would betray him.
43013026	Description	Yeshua [Salvation] therefore answered, “It is he to whom I will give this piece of matzah ·unleavened bread· when I have dipped it (in the bitter herbs).” So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas [Praised], the son of Simeon [Hearing] from K'riot.
43013020	Faith	Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.”
43017010	Faith	All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.
43007018	Faith	He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
43008054	Faith	Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is 'Avi ·my Father· who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.
43019040	Description	So they took Yeshua [Salvation]'s body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews [Praisers] is to bury.
43010031	Violence	Therefore Jews [Praisers] took up stones again to stone him.
43019010	Description	Pilate [Armed with javelin] therefore said to him, “Are not you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”
43017022	Grace	The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
43002006	Description	Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Judean [Person from Praise] way of purifying, containing two to three metretes [20 to 30 gal; 37.85 to 75.7 L] for each pot, [a total of 1,200 to 1,800 gal; 188.7 to 315 L].
43014010	Faith	Don’t you believe that I am in haAbba ·the Father·, and haAbba ·the Father· in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but haAbba ·the Father· who lives in me does his works.
43013034	Recommendation	A new commandment I give to you, that you show agapao ·total devotion love· to one another. Just as I have had agapao ·totally devoted love· towards you, you also show agapao ·totally devoted love· to one another.
43012044	Faith	Yeshua [Salvation] cried out and said, “Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.
