43015002	Grace	[ As to ] every branch in me not bearing fruit , he takes it away ; and [ as to ] every one bearing fruit , he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit .

43013021	Description	Having said these things , Jesus was troubled in spirit , and testified and said , Verily , verily , I say to you , that one of you shall deliver me up .

66011007	Violence	And when they shall have completed their testimony , the beast who comes up out of the abyss shall make war with them , and shall conquer them , and shall kill them :

58010029	Sin	of how much worse punishment , think ye , shall he be judged worthy who has trodden under foot the Son of God , and esteemed the blood of the covenant , whereby he has been sanctified , common , and has insulted the Spirit of grace ?

66006015	Description	And the kings of the earth , and the great , and the chiliarchs , and the rich , and the strong , and every bondman and freeman , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains ;

66009008	Description	and they had hair as women's hair , and their teeth were as of lions ,
55002024	Recommendation	And a bondman of [ the ] Lord ought not to contend , but be gentle towards all ; apt to teach ; forbearing ;
51002005	Faith	For if indeed in the flesh I am absent , yet I am with you in spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the firmness of your faith in Christ .
60003012	Sin	because [ the ] eyes of [ the ] Lord [ are ] on [ the ] righteous , and his ears towards their supplications ; but [ the ] face of [ the ] Lord [ is ] against them that do evil .
53002013	Faith	But we ought to give thanks to God always for you , brethren beloved of [ the ] Lord , that God has chosen you from [ the ] beginning to salvation in sanctification of [ the ] Spirit and belief of [ the ] truth :

43006054	Faith	He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal , and I will raise him up at the last day :
43019011	Sin	Jesus answered , Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above . On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [ the ] greater sin .
59002017	Faith	So also faith , if it have not works , is dead by itself .
45008003	Sin	For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God , having sent his own Son , in likeness of flesh of sin , and for sin , has condemned sin in the flesh ,
60003014	Recommendation	But if also ye should suffer for righteousness' sake , blessed [ are ye ] ; but be not afraid of their fear , neither be troubled ;

66018003	Sin	because all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication ; and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth have been enriched through the might of her luxury .
44026021	Violence	On account of these things the Jews , having seized me in the temple , attempted to lay hands on and destroy me .
55004004	Sin	and they will turn away their ear from the truth , and will have turned aside to fables .

62005016	Sin	If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life , for those that do not sin unto death . There is a sin to death : I do not say of that that he should make a request .
43013020	Faith	Verily , verily , I say to you , He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me ; and he that receives me receives him who has sent me .
58012028	Faith	Wherefore let us , receiving a kingdom not to be shaken , have grace , by which let us serve God acceptably with reverence and fear .
44019013	Description	And certain of the Jewish exorcists also , who went about , took in hand to call upon those who had wicked spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , I adjure you by Jesus , whom Paul preaches .
44015040	Grace	but Paul having chosen Silas went forth , committed by the brethren to the grace of God .

44008021	Sin	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter , for thy heart is not upright before God .
43017010	Faith	( and all that is mine is thine , and [ all ] that is thine mine , ) and I am glorified in them .
45003012	Sin	All have gone out of the way , they have together become unprofitable ; there is not one that practises goodness , there is not so much as one :

60004007	Recommendation	But the end of all things is drawn nigh : be sober therefore , and be watchful unto prayers ;
44014026	Grace	and thence they sailed away to Antioch , whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled .
46007028	Recommendation	But if thou shouldest also marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if the virgin marry , they have not sinned : but such shall have tribulation in the flesh ; but I spare you .
49006012	Sin	because our struggle is not against blood and flesh , but against principalities , against authorities , against the universal lords of this darkness , against spiritual [ power ] of wickedness in the heavenlies .

58006019	Faith	which we have as anchor of the soul , both secure and firm , and entering into that within the veil ,
49005011	Recommendation	and do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather also reprove [ them ] ,
59004011	Recommendation	Speak not against one another , brethren . He that speaks against [ his ] brother , or judges his brother , speaks against [ the ] law and judges [ the ] law . But if thou judgest [ the ] law , thou art not doer of [ the ] law , but judge .
66021021	Description	And the twelve gates , twelve pearls ; each one of the gates , respectively , was of one pearl ; and the street of the city pure gold , as transparent glass .

43014010	Faith	Believest thou not that I [ am ] in the Father , and that the Father is in me ? The words which I speak to you I do not speak from myself ; but the Father who abides in me , he does the works .
44016022	Violence	And the crowd rose up too against them ; and the praetors , having torn off their clothes , commanded to scourge [ them ] .

45014014	Sin	I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself ; except to him who reckons anything to be unclean , to that man [ it is ] unclean .
54004006	Faith	Laying these things before the brethren , thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus , nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast fully followed up .
