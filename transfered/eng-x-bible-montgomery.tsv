61003005	Sin	For they willingly ignore the fact that there were heaven , from of old , and an earth formed out of water and through water , by the word of God ;
60003018	Grace	because Christ also once for all suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God . He was put to death in the flesh , but make alive in spirit .
61002021	Sin	Indeed it would have been better for them not to have known the Way of Righteousness , than , after knowing it , to turn back from the holy command delivered to them .
