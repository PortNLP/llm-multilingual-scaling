65001010	Sin	and these, as many things indeed as they have not known, they speak evil of; and as many things as naturally (as the irrational beasts) they understand, in these they are corrupted;

45015005	Grace	And may the God of the endurance, and of the exhortation, give to you to have the same mind toward one another, according to Christ Jesus;
58007027	Description	who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;
