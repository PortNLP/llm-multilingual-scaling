62003016	Faith	In this we see what love is, because he gave his life for us; and it is right for us to give our lives for the brothers.
43013001	Grace	Now before the feast of the Passover, it was clear to Jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to the Father. Having once had love for those in the world who were his, his love for them went on to the end.
58003017	Sin	And with whom was he angry for forty years? was it not with those who did evil, who came to their deaths in the waste land?
60001014	Recommendation	Like children ruled by God, do not go back to the old desires of the time when you were without knowledge:
45011032	Grace	For God has let them all go against his orders, so that he might have mercy on them all.
66006006	Description	And a voice came to my ears, from the middle of the four beasts, saying, A measure of grain for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny: and see that you do no damage to the oil and the wine.
59004010	Recommendation	Make yourselves low in the eyes of the Lord and you will be lifted up by him.
44017031	Grace	Because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work; of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead.
43019002	Description	And the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him.
54005014	Recommendation	So it is my desire that the younger widows may be married and have children, controlling their families, and giving the Evil One no chance to say anything against them,
43014011	Faith	Have faith that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me: at least, have faith in me because of what I do.
66020014	Violence	And death and Hell were put into the sea of fire. This is the second death, even the sea of fire.
58009026	Description	For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world: but now he has come to us at the end of the old order, to put away sin by the offering of himself.
44013018	Description	And for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land.
46011033	Recommendation	So then, my brothers, when you come together to the holy meal of the Lord, let there be waiting for one another.
66006012	Violence	And I saw when the sixth stamp was undone, and there was a great earth-shock; and the sun became black as haircloth, and all the moon became as blood;
58011035	Violence	Women had their dead given back to them living; others let themselves be cruelly attacked, having no desire to go free, so that they might have a better life to come;
44016037	Violence	But Paul said to them, They have given us who are Romans a public whipping without judging us, and have put us in prison. Will they now send us out secretly? no, truly, let them come themselves and take us out.
45013009	Recommendation	And this, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not put to death, Do not take what is another's, Do not have desire for what is another's, and if there is any other order, it is covered by this word, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.
62003003	Faith	And everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy, even as he is holy.
45007022	Faith	In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God,
50004004	Recommendation	Be glad in the Lord at all times: again I say, Be glad.
66001012	Description	And turning to see the voice which said these words to me, I saw seven gold vessels with lights burning in them;
58003018	Sin	And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest? was it not to those who went against his orders?
43010008	Sin	All who came before me are thieves and outlaws: but the sheep did not give ear to them.
60002018	Recommendation	Servants, take orders from your masters with all respect; not only if they are good and gentle, but even if they are bad-humoured.
44006013	Description	And they got false witnesses who said, This man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law:
47005018	Faith	But all things are of God, who has made us at peace with himself through Christ, and has given to us the work of making peace;
59005010	Recommendation	Take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble, the prophets who gave to men the words of the Lord.
44002021	Faith	And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation.
66007012	Faith	So be it. Let blessing and glory and wisdom and praise and honour and power and strength be given to our God for ever and ever. So be it.
60003003	Recommendation	Do not let your ornaments be those of the body such as dressing of the hair, or putting on of jewels of gold or fair clothing;
55001008	Faith	Have no feeling of shame, then, for the witness of our Lord or for me, his prisoner: but undergo all things for the good news in the measure of the power of God;
43017019	Description	And for them I make myself holy, so that they may be made truly holy.
66003002	Recommendation	Be on the watch, and make strong the rest of the things which are near to death; because as judged by me your works have not come up to God's measure.
66016004	Description	And the third let what was in his vessel come out into the rivers and the fountains of water; and they became blood.
45005002	Faith	Through whom, in the same way, we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are; and let us have joy in hope of the glory of God.
49005005	Sin	Being certain of this, that no man who gives way to the passions of the flesh, no unclean person, or one who has desire for the property of others, or who gives worship to images, has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and God.
58011008	Faith	By faith Abraham did as God said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage, and went out without knowledge of where he was going.
49005018	Recommendation	And do not take overmuch wine by which one may be overcome, but be full of the Spirit;
61002002	Sin	And a great number will go with them in their evil ways, through whom the true way will have a bad name.
49002018	Faith	Because through him the two of us are able to come near in one Spirit to the Father.
44021025	Recommendation	But as to the Gentiles who have the faith, we sent a letter, giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods, and from blood, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from the evil desires of the body.
44005003	Sin	But Peter said, Ananias, why has the Evil One put it into your heart to be false to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
49004014	Recommendation	So that we may be no longer children, sent this way and that, turned about by every wind of teaching, by the twisting and tricks of men, by the deceits of error;
46006009	Sin	Have you not knowledge that evil-doers will have no part in the kingdom of God? Have no false ideas about this: no one who goes after the desires of the flesh, or gives worship to images, or is untrue when married, or is less than a man, or makes a wrong use of men,
58010025	Recommendation	Not giving up our meetings, as is the way of some, but keeping one another strong in faith; and all the more because you see the day coming near.
51003005	Sin	Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth; wrong use of the flesh, unclean things, passion, evil desires and envy, which is the worship of strange gods;
52005008	Faith	But let us, who are of the day, be serious, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and on our heads, the hope of salvation.
55001007	Grace	For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of self-control.
62002004	Sin	The man who says, I have knowledge of him, and does not keep his laws, is false, and there is nothing true in him:
50002002	Faith	Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in harmony and of one mind;
43007030	Description	Then they had a desire to take him: but no man put hands on him because his hour was still to come.
54006018	Recommendation	And to do good, having wealth in good works, being quick to give, taking part with one another;
43018030	Description	They said to him in answer, If the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you.
45014006	Faith	He who keeps the day, keeps it to the Lord; and he who takes food, takes it as to the Lord, for he gives praise to God; and he who does not take food, to the Lord he takes it not, and gives praise to God.
45012012	Recommendation	Being glad in hope, quiet in trouble, at all times given to prayer,
44024023	Description	And he gave orders to the captain to keep Paul under his control, and to let him have everything he had need of; and not to keep his friends from coming to see him.
46013007	Description	Love has the power of undergoing all things, having faith in all things, hoping all things.
47004013	Faith	But having the same spirit of faith, as it is said in the Writings, The words of my mouth came from the faith in my heart; in the same way, our words are the outcome of our faith;
52005014	Recommendation	And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered, giving comfort to the feeble-hearted, supporting those with little strength, and putting up with much from all.
66016010	Description	And the fifth let what was in his vessel come out on the high seat of the beast; and his kingdom was made dark; and they were biting their tongues for pain.
48006016	Grace	And on all who are guided by this rule be peace and mercy, and on the Israel of God.
44018025	Faith	This man had been trained in the way of the Lord; and burning in spirit, he gave himself up to teaching the facts about Jesus, though he had knowledge only of John's baptism:
46010031	Recommendation	So then, if it is a question of food or drink, or any other thing, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
62002027	Recommendation	As for you, the Spirit which he gave you is still in you, and you have no need of any teacher; but as his Spirit gives you teaching about all things, and is true and not false, so keep your hearts in him, through the teaching which he has given you.
59002026	Faith	For as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead.
44027035	Description	And when he had said this and had taken bread, he gave praise to God before them all, and took a meal of the broken bread.
44015020	Sin	But that we give them orders to keep themselves from things offered to false gods, and from the evil desires of the body, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from blood.
44023003	Sin	Then Paul said to him, God will give blows to you, you whitewashed wall: are you here to be my judge by law, and by your orders am I given blows against the law?
45008001	Description	For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners.
52005009	Grace	For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
66020008	Violence	And will go out to put in error the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to get them together to the war, the number of whom is like the sands of the sea.
46006011	Grace	And such were some of you; but you have been washed, you have been made holy, you have been given righteousness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
55001012	Faith	And for which I undergo these things: but I have no feeling of shame. For I have knowledge of him in whom I have faith, and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have given into his care till that day.
49006018	Faith	With prayers and deep desires, making requests at all times in the Spirit, and keeping watch, with strong purpose, in prayer for all the saints,
52001001	Grace	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
50004005	Faith	Let your gentle behaviour be clear to all men. The Lord is near.
46011026	Faith	For whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the Lord's death till he comes.
59005015	Faith	And by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well, and he will be lifted up by the Lord, and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness.
55001003	Faith	I give praise to God, whose servant I have been, with a heart free from sin, from the time of my fathers, because in my prayers at all times the thought of you is with me, night and day
66006016	Description	And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Come down on us, covering us from the face of him who is seated on the high seat, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
66002017	Description	He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give of the secret manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name, of which no one has knowledge but he to whom it is given.
61002003	Sin	And in their desire for profit they will come to you with words of deceit, like traders doing business in souls: whose punishment has been ready for a long time and their destruction is watching for them.
53002011	Sin	And for this cause, God will give them up to the power of deceit and they will put their faith in what is false:
45002024	Sin	For the name of God is shamed among the Gentiles because of you, as it is said in the holy Writings.
55003008	Sin	And as James and Jambres went against Moses, so do these go against what is true: men of evil minds, who, tested by faith, are seen to be false.
66003019	Recommendation	To all those who are dear to me, I give sharp words and punishment: then with all your heart have sorrow for your evil ways.
45005001	Faith	For which reason, because we have righteousness through faith, let us be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
54004016	Recommendation	Give attention to yourself and your teaching. Go on in these things; for in doing so you will get salvation for yourself and for those who give hearing to you.
44026011	Violence	And I gave them punishment frequently, in all the Synagogues, forcing them to say things against God; and burning with passion against them, I went after them even into far-away towns.
48005019	Sin	Now the works of the flesh are clear, which are these: evil desire, unclean things, wrong use of the senses,
46003007	Grace	So then the planter is nothing, and the waterer is nothing; but God who gives the increase.
46001007	Faith	So that having every grace you are living in the hope of the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
66014002	Description	And a voice from heaven came to my ears, like the sound of great waters, and the sound of loud thunder: and the voice which came to me was like the sound of players, playing on instruments of music.
44010043	Faith	To him all the prophets give witness, that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins.
45002007	Faith	To those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death, he will give eternal life:
66001004	Grace	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and was and is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his high seat;
44019004	Faith	And Paul said, John gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart, saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.
61002009	Violence	The Lord is able to keep the upright safe in the time of testing, and to keep evil-doers under punishment till the day of judging;
58011016	Grace	But now their desire is for a better country, that is to say, for one in heaven; and so it is no shame to God to be named their God; for he has made ready a town for them.
54004007	Recommendation	But have nothing to do with unclean and foolish stories. Give yourself training in religion:
66020009	Violence	And they went up over the face of the earth, and made a circle about the tents of the saints, and the well loved town: and fire came down out of heaven for their destruction.
44010048	Description	And he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they kept him with them for some days.
45002019	Grace	In the belief that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those in the dark,
62002025	Grace	And this is the hope which he gave you, even eternal life.
59003017	Description	But the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy, then gentle, readily giving way in argument, full of peace and mercy and good works, not doubting, not seeming other than it is.
43003035	Faith	The Father has love for the Son and has put all things into his hands.
61003009	Grace	The Lord is not slow in keeping his word, as he seems to some, but he is waiting in mercy for you, not desiring the destruction of any, but that all may be turned from their evil ways.
46007007	Grace	It is my desire that all men might be even as I am. But every man has the power of his special way of life given him by God, one in this way and one in that.
46014001	Recommendation	Go after love; still desiring to have the things which the Spirit gives, but most of all that you may have the prophet's power.
47004006	Grace	Seeing that it is God who said, Let light be shining out of the dark, who has put in our hearts the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
44018024	Description	Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, and a man of learning, came to Ephesus; and he had great knowledge of the holy Writings.
58013012	Grace	For this reason Jesus was put to death outside the walls, so that he might make the people holy by his blood.
56002015	Recommendation	On all these points give teaching and help, and make clear what is right with all authority. Let all men give you honour.
62004009	Grace	And the love of God was made clear to us when he sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him.
43017024	Grace	Father, it is my desire that these whom you have given to me may be by my side where I am, so that they may see my glory which you have given to me, because you had love for me before the world came into being.
45003016	Sin	Destruction and trouble are in their ways;
58004014	Faith	Having then a great high priest, who has made his way through the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us be strong in our faith.
61001017	Grace	For God the Father gave him honour and glory, when such a voice came to him out of the great glory, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased.
46012011	Description	But all these are the operations of the one and the same Spirit, giving to every man separately as his pleasure is.
66008012	Description	And at the sounding of the fourth angel, a third part of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars was made dark, so that there was no light for a third part of the day and of the night.
44018017	Violence	And they all made an attack on Sosthenes, the ruler of the Synagogue, and gave him blows before the judge's seat; but Gallio gave no attention to these things.
43010039	Violence	Then again they made an attempt to take him; but he got away from them.
47004016	Faith	For which cause we do not give way to weariness; but though our outer man is getting feebler, our inner man is made new day by day.
43012003	Description	Then Mary, taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value, put it on the feet of Jesus and made them dry with her hair: and the house became full of the smell of the perfume.
58011009	Faith	By faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement, as in a strange land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who had a part with him in the same heritage:
50003017	Recommendation	Brothers, take me as your example, and take note of those who are walking after the example we have given.
48006002	Recommendation	Take on yourselves one another's troubles, and so keep the law of Christ.
59002024	Faith	You see that a man's righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only.
45009014	Faith	What may we say then? is God not upright? let it not be said.
45014001	Recommendation	Do not put on one side him who is feeble in faith, and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings.
66012007	Violence	And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels going out to the fight with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels made war,
49004026	Recommendation	Be angry without doing wrong; let not the sun go down on your wrath;
60003009	Recommendation	Not giving back evil for evil, or curse for curse, but in place of cursing, blessing; because this is the purpose of God for you that you may have a heritage of blessing.
43008029	Grace	He who sent me is with me; he has not gone from me, because at all times I do the things which are pleasing to him.
49006014	Recommendation	Take your place, then, having your body clothed with the true word, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness;
66001020	Description	The secret of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold vessels with burning lights. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven lights are the seven churches.
58002009	Grace	But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of God he might undergo death for all men.
50002013	Grace	For it is God who is the cause of your desires and of your acts, for his good pleasure.
43015011	Grace	I have said these things to you so that I may have joy in you and so that your joy may be complete.
54001001	Description	Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the order of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope;
54002009	Recommendation	And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price;
43002015	Violence	And he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the Temple, with the sheep and the oxen, sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables;
49002010	Grace	For by his act we were given existence in Christ Jesus to do those good works which God before made ready for us so that we might do them.
60004012	Recommendation	Dear brothers, do not be surprised, as if it was something strange, if your faith is tested as by fire:
66019007	Recommendation	Let us be glad with delight, and let us give glory to him: because the time is come for the Lamb to be married, and his wife has made herself ready.
49006017	Recommendation	And take salvation for your head-dress and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
44007024	Violence	And seeing one of them being attacked, he went to his help and gave the Egyptian a death-blow:
53003013	Recommendation	And you, my brothers, do not get tired of well-doing.
46016013	Faith	Be on the watch, unmoved in the faith, and be strong like men.
44007043	Sin	And you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan, images which you made to give worship to them: and I will take you away, farther than Babylon.
53002015	Recommendation	So then, brothers, be strong in purpose, and keep the teaching which has been given to you by word or by letter from us.
47005005	Grace	Now he who has made us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a witness of what is to come.
54002011	Recommendation	Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority.
54005019	Recommendation	Do not take as true any statement made against one in authority, but only if two or three give witness to it.
45016016	Recommendation	Give one another a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send their love to you.
66018019	Description	And they put dust on their heads, and were sad, weeping and crying, and saying, Sorrow, sorrow for the great town, in which was increased the wealth of all who had their ships on the sea because of her great stores! for in one hour she is made waste.
62003001	Grace	See what great love the Father has given us in naming us the children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world does not see who we are, because it did not see who he was.
60005005	Recommendation	And in the same way, let the younger men be ruled by the older ones. Let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants: for God is a hater of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low.
45003004	Faith	In no way: but let God be true, though every man is seen to be untrue; as it is said in the Writings, That your words may be seen to be true, and you may be seen to be right when you are judged.
44009014	Violence	And here he has authority from the chief priests to make prisoners all who give worship to your name.
61002001	Sin	But there were false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly put forward wrong teachings for your destruction, even turning away from the Lord who gave himself for them; whose destruction will come quickly, and they themselves will be the cause of it.
43005018	Violence	For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death, because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father, so making himself equal with God.
46011002	Faith	Now I am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things, and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you.
44002025	Faith	For David said of him, I saw the Lord before my face at all times, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved:
60001023	Grace	Because you have had a new birth, not from the seed of man, but from eternal seed, through the word of a living and unchanging God.
59005016	Recommendation	So then, make a statement of your sins to one another, and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well. The prayer of a good man is full of power in its working.
43006047	Faith	Truly I say to you, He who has faith in me has eternal life.
43014018	Grace	I will not let you be without a friend: I am coming to you.
45003002	Grace	Much in every way: first of all because the words of God were given to them.
49006005	Recommendation	Servants, do what is ordered by those who are your natural masters, having respect and fear for them, with all your heart, as to Christ;
45002004	Grace	Or is it nothing to you that God had pity on you, waiting and putting up with you for so long, not seeing that in his pity God's desire is to give you a change of heart?
62005014	Faith	And we are certain that if we make any request to him which is right in his eyes, he will give ear to us:
45015013	Faith	Now may the God of hope make you full of joy and peace through faith, so that all hope may be yours in the power of the Holy Spirit.
43019041	Description	Now there was a garden near the cross, and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put.
66019020	Violence	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him, by which they were turned from the true way who had the mark of the beast, and who gave worship to his image: these two were put living into the sea of ever-burning fire.
45012020	Recommendation	But if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink, give it to him, for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head.
51003016	Recommendation	Let the word of Christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom; teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words, making melody to God with grace in your hearts.
51003019	Recommendation	Husbands, have love for your wives, and be not bitter against them.
54005016	Recommendation	If any woman of the faith has relations who are widows, let her give them help, so that the care of them does not come on the church, and so it may give help to those who are truly widowed.
62005011	Grace	And his witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
62005012	Faith	He who has the Son has the life; he who has not the Son of God has not the life.
43008036	Grace	If then the son makes you free, you will be truly free.
49003013	Faith	For this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you, which are your glory.
45016018	Sin	For such people are not servants of the Lord Christ, but of their stomachs; and by their smooth and well-said words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked.
45001029	Sin	Being full of all wrongdoing, evil, desire for the goods of others, hate, envy, putting to death, fighting, deceit, cruel ways, evil talk, and false statements about others;
55001014	Recommendation	That good thing which was given to you keep safe, through the Holy Spirit which is in us.
48006008	Faith	Because he who puts in the seed of the flesh will of the flesh get the reward of death; but he who puts in the seed of the Spirit will of the Spirit get the reward of eternal life.
46010009	Recommendation	And let us not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did, and came to their death by snakes.
46013005	Recommendation	Love's ways are ever fair, it takes no thought for itself; it is not quickly made angry, it takes no account of evil;
66009009	Description	And they had breastplates like iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of carriages, like an army of horses rushing to the fight.
43015022	Sin	If I had not come and been their teacher they would have had no sin: but now they have no reason to give for their sin.
51004005	Recommendation	Be wise in your behaviour to those who are outside, making good use of the time.
45006006	Faith	Being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him, so that the body of sin might be put away, and we might no longer be servants to sin.
62003010	Sin	In this way it is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the Evil One; anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother, is not a child of God.
45008007	Sin	Because the mind of the flesh is opposite to God; it is not under the law of God, and is not able to be:
44002026	Faith	And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy, and my flesh will be resting in hope:
46010020	Sin	What I say is that the things offered by the Gentiles are offered to evil spirits and not to God; and it is not my desire for you to have any part with evil spirits.
44013001	Description	Now there were at Antioch, in the church there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon who was named Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, a relation of Herod the king, and Saul.
49005006	Recommendation	Do not be turned from the right way by foolish words; for because of these things the punishment of God comes on those who do not put themselves under him.
56001011	Sin	By whom some families have been completely overturned; who take money for teaching things which are not right; these will have to be stopped.
43013011	Sin	(He had knowledge who was false to him; that is why he said, You are not all clean.)
43010001	Sin	Truly I say to you, He who does not go through the door into the place where the sheep are kept, but gets in by some other way, is a thief and an outlaw.
61002015	Sin	Turning out of the true way, they have gone wandering in error, after the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who was pleased to take payment for wrongdoing;
44014005	Violence	And when a violent attempt was made by the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, to make an attack on them and have them stoned,
43021017	Description	He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, am I dear to you? Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time, Am I dear to you? And he said to him, Lord, you have knowledge of all things; you see that you are dear to me. Jesus said to him, Then give my sheep food.
66021027	Sin	And nothing unclean may come into it, or anyone whose works are cursed or false; but only those whose names are in the Lamb's book of life.
66017004	Sin	And the woman was clothed in purple and bright red, with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels; and in her hand was a gold cup full of evil things and her unclean desires;
51003014	Recommendation	And more than all, have love; the only way in which you may be completely joined together.
43012023	Description	And Jesus said to them in answer, The hour of the glory of the Son of man has come.
45002022	Sin	You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife, are you true to yours? you who are a hater of images, do you do wrong to the house of God?
45007008	Sin	But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead.
44026017	Grace	And I will keep you safe from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,
56003003	Sin	For in the past we were foolish, hard in heart, turned from the true way, servants of evil desires and pleasures, living in bad feeling and envy, hated and hating one another.
54005021	Recommendation	I give you orders before God and Christ Jesus and the angels of God's selection, to keep these orders without giving thought to one side more than another.
58010035	Recommendation	So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded.
46004002	Faith	And it is right for such servants to be safe persons.
44009043	Description	And he was living in Joppa for some time with Simon, a leather-worker.
46003016	Grace	Do you not see that you are God's holy house, and that the Spirit of God has his place in you?
58010019	Faith	So then, my brothers, being able to go into the holy place without fear, because of the blood of Jesus,
43008021	Sin	Then he said to them again, I am going away and you will be looking for me, but death will overtake you in your sins. It is not possible for you to come where I am going.
51003012	Recommendation	As saints of God, then, holy and dearly loved, let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy, kind feeling, a low opinion of yourselves, gentle ways, and a power of undergoing all things;
43012026	Faith	If any man is my servant, let him come after me; and where I am, there will my servant be. If any man becomes my servant, my Father will give him honour.
54003004	Description	Ruling his house well, having his children under control with all serious behaviour;
52005011	Recommendation	So then, go on comforting and building up one another, as you have been doing.
62003011	Recommendation	Because this is the word which was given to you from the first, that we are to have love for one another;
46007026	Recommendation	In my opinion then, because of the present trouble, it is good for a man to keep as he is.
43003001	Description	Now there was among the Pharisees a man named Nicodemus, who was one of the rulers of the Jews.
59002025	Description	And in the same way, was not the righteousness of Rahab, the loose woman, judged by her works, when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way?
54002015	Faith	But if they go on in faith and love and holy self-control, she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth.
44013017	Grace	The God of this people Israel made selection of our fathers, lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of Egypt, and with a strong arm took them out of it.
44015008	Grace	And God, the searcher of hearts, was a witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit even as he did to us;
59002011	Sin	For he who said, Do not be untrue in married life, is the same who said, Put no man to death. Now if you are not untrue in married life, but you put a man to death, the law is broken.
43010028	Grace	And I give them eternal life; they will never come to destruction, and no one will ever take them out of my hand.
45016020	Grace	And the God of peace will be crushing Satan under your feet before long. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
55003005	Sin	Having a form of religion, but turning their backs on the power of it: go not with these.
45012005	Description	So we, though we are a number of persons, are one body in Christ, and are dependent on one another;
56003008	Faith	This is a true saying; and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things, so that those who have had faith in God may give attention to good works. These things are good and of profit to men;
59002023	Faith	And the holy Writings were put into effect which said, And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness; and he was named the friend of God.
59002001	Faith	My brothers, if you have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory, do not take a man's position into account.
45003013	Sin	Their throat is like an open place of death; with their tongues they have said what is not true: the poison of snakes is under their lips:
49005028	Recommendation	Even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies. He who has love for his wife has love for himself:
45009030	Faith	What then may we say? That the nations who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:
54003009	Faith	Keeping the secret of the faith in a heart free from sin.
54006002	Recommendation	And let those whose masters are of the faith have respect for them because they are brothers, working for them the more readily, because those who take part in the good work are of the faith and are dear. Give orders and teaching about these things.
45003003	Faith	And if some have no faith, will that make the faith of God without effect?
43019034	Violence	But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear, and straight away there came out blood and water.
43015012	Recommendation	This is the law I give you: Have love one for another, even as I have love for you.
45006013	Recommendation	And do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing, but give yourselves to God, as those who are living from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God.
58010039	Faith	But we are not of those who go back to destruction; but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul.
45011026	Grace	And so all Israel will get salvation: as it is said in the holy Writings, There will come out of Zion the One who makes free; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob:
52002015	Violence	Who put to death the Lord Jesus and the prophets, violently driving us out; who are unpleasing to God and against all men;
58010026	Sin	For if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true, there is no more offering for sins,
49002006	Grace	So that we came back from death with him, and are seated with him in the heavens, in Christ Jesus;
49004025	Recommendation	And so, putting away false words, let everyone say what is true to his neighbour: for we are parts one of another.
48002005	Faith	To whom we gave way not even for an hour; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you.
46014013	Recommendation	For this reason, let the man who has the power of using tongues make request that he may, at the same time, be able to give the sense.
44009001	Violence	But Saul, still burning with desire to put to death the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
43017013	Description	And now I come to you; and these things I say in the world so that they may have my joy complete in them.
60004013	Recommendation	But be glad that you are given a part in the pains of Christ; so that at the revelation of his glory you may have great joy.
44011006	Description	And looking on it with attention I saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds.
51003008	Recommendation	But now it is right for you to put away all these things; wrath, passion, bad feeling, curses, unclean talk;
44018003	Description	And because he was of the same trade, he was living with them, and they did their work together; for by trade they were tent-makers.
45006012	Sin	For this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death, so that you give way to its desires;
53003012	Recommendation	Now to such we give orders and make request in the Lord Jesus, that, working quietly, they get their living.
44007009	Sin	And the brothers, moved with envy against Joseph, gave him to the Egyptians for money: but God was with him,
44011028	Description	And one of them, named Agabus, said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth: which came about in the time of Claudius.
44020036	Description	And having said these words, he went down on his knees in prayer with them all.
48005024	Faith	And those who are Christ's have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires.
59001002	Recommendation	Let it be all joy to you, my brothers, when you undergo tests of every sort;
62001006	Sin	If we say we are joined to him, and are walking still in the dark, our words are false and our acts are untrue:
44010011	Description	And he saw the heavens opening, and a vessel coming down, like a great cloth let down on the earth,
44002009	Description	Men of Parthia, Media, and Elam, and those living in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
51001010	Faith	Living uprightly in the approval of the Lord, giving fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
54001018	Recommendation	This order I give to you, Timothy my son, in harmony with the words of the prophets about you, so that by them you may be strong, fighting the good fight,
66019001	Faith	After these things there came to my ears a sound like the voice of a great band of people in heaven, saying, Praise to the Lord; salvation and glory and power be to our God:
49002001	Grace	And to you did he give life, when you were dead through your wrongdoing and sins,
46010021	Sin	It is not possible for you, at the same time, to take the cup of the Lord and the cup of evil spirits; you may not take part in the table of the Lord and the table of evil spirits.
49005003	Recommendation	But evil acts of the flesh and all unclean things, or desire for others' property, let it not even be named among you, as is right for saints;
56001015	Sin	To the clean in heart all things are clean: but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean; they become unclean in mind and in thought.
44009021	Description	And all those hearing him were full of wonder and said, Is not this the man who in Jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name? and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests.
58008006	Description	But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things.
50001021	Faith	For to me life is Christ and death is profit.
50001006	Faith	For I am certain of this very thing, that he by whom the good work was started in you will make it complete till the day of Jesus Christ:
62005020	Faith	And we are certain that the Son of God has come, and has given us a clear vision, so that we may see him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
45012018	Recommendation	As far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men.
58010023	Faith	Let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking, for he is true who has given his word:
43014027	Grace	May peace be with you; my peace I give to you: I give it not as the world gives. Let not your heart be troubled; let it be without fear.
47005006	Faith	So, then, we are ever without fear, and though conscious that while we are in the body we are away from the Lord,
43012047	Grace	And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them, I am not his judge: I did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world.
62003012	Sin	Not being of the Evil One like Cain, who put his brother to death. And why did he put him to death? Because his works were evil and his brother's works were good.
66016020	Description	And every island went in flight, and the mountains were seen no longer.
58011012	Description	So that from one man, who was near to death, came children in number as the stars in heaven, or as the sand by the seaside, which may not be numbered.
54001017	Faith	Now to the King eternal, ever-living, unseen, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. So be it.
66014007	Faith	Saying with a loud voice, Have fear of God and give him glory; because the hour of his judging is come; and give worship to him who made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water.
44006001	Description	Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was increasing, protests were made by the Greek Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were not taken care of in the distribution of food every day.
60002021	Grace	This is God's purpose for you: because Jesus himself underwent punishment for you, giving you an example, so that you might go in his footsteps:
53003010	Recommendation	For even when we were with you we gave you orders, saying, If any man does no work, let him not have food.
43003016	Grace	For God had such love for the world that he gave his only Son, so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life.
44019015	Description	And the evil spirit, answering, said to them, I have knowledge of Jesus, and of Paul, but who are you?
66019019	Violence	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, come together to make war against him who was seated on the horse and against his army.
44027002	Description	And we went to sea in a ship of Adramyttium which was sailing to the sea towns of Asia, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
58013003	Recommendation	Keep in mind those who are in chains, as if you were chained with them, and those who are in trouble, as being yourselves in the body.
51003017	Recommendation	And whatever you do, in word or in act, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving praise to God the Father through him.
48006006	Recommendation	But let him who gets teaching in the word give a part in all good things to his teacher.
44007005	Description	And God gave him no heritage in it, not even enough to put his foot on: but he gave him an undertaking that he would give it to him and to his children after him, though he had no child at that time.
44007019	Description	He, having evil designs against our nation, was cruel to our fathers, and they were forced to put out their young children, so that they might not go on living.
43020003	Description	So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead.
44024016	Faith	And in this, I do my best at all times to have no reason for shame before God or men.
65001013	Description	Violent waves of the sea, streaming with their shame, wandering stars for whom the darkest night is kept in store for ever.
48001012	Description	For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.
45007005	Sin	For when we were in the flesh, the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death.
54002007	Faith	And of this I became a preacher and an Apostle (what I say is true, not false,) and a teacher of the Gentiles in the true faith.
62003024	Faith	He who keeps his laws is in God and God is in him. And the Spirit which he gave us is our witness that he is in us.
46010024	Recommendation	Let a man give attention not only to what is good for himself, but equally to his neighbour's good.
45012016	Recommendation	Be in harmony with one another. Do not have a high opinion of yourselves, but be in agreement with common people. Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom.
49004031	Recommendation	Let all bitter, sharp and angry feeling, and noise, and evil words, be put away from you, with all unkind acts;
51001025	Faith	Of which I became a servant by the purpose of God which was given to me for you, to give effect to the word of God,
66001014	Description	And his head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
47004015	Grace	For we go through all things on account of you, because the greater the number to whom the grace is given, the greater is the praise to the glory of God.
43006056	Faith	He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink is in me and I in him.
43011027	Faith	She said to him, Yes, Lord: my faith is that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.
44002042	Faith	And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer.
58001009	Grace	You have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil; and so God, your God, has put the oil of joy on your head more than on the heads of those who are with you.
44012002	Violence	And he put James, the brother of John, to death with the sword.
55002016	Recommendation	But take no part in wrong and foolish talk, for those who do so will go farther into evil,
62003015	Sin	Anyone who has hate for his brother is a taker of life, and you may be certain that no taker of life has eternal life in him.
43021015	Faith	Then when they had taken food, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, is your love for me greater than the love of these others? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you are certain of my love for you. He said to him, Then give my lambs food.
46012008	Grace	For to one are given words of wisdom through the Spirit; and to another words of knowledge through the same Spirit:
44007013	Description	And the second time his brothers had a meeting with Joseph, and Pharaoh had knowledge of Joseph's family.
60003010	Recommendation	For it is said, Let the man who has a love of life, desiring to see good days, keep his tongue from evil and his lips from words of deceit:
44004032	Description	And all those who were of the faith were one in heart and soul: and not one of them said that any of the things which he had was his property only; but they had all things in common.
46015003	Grace	For I gave to you first of all what was handed down to me, how Christ underwent death for our sins, as it says in the Writings;
66018024	Violence	And in her was seen the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been put to death on the earth.
44013048	Faith	And the Gentiles, hearing this, were glad and gave glory to the word of God: and those marked out by God for eternal life had faith.
66022020	Description	He who gives witness to these things says, Truly, I come quickly. Even so come, Lord Jesus.
50004009	Recommendation	The things which came to you by my teaching and preaching, and which you saw in me, these things do, and the God of peace will be with you.
53003015	Recommendation	Have no feeling of hate for him, but take him in hand seriously as a brother.
51002008	Recommendation	Take care that no one takes you away by force, through man's wisdom and deceit, going after the beliefs of men and the theories of the world, and not after Christ:
50003014	Faith	I go forward to the mark, even the reward of the high purpose of God in Christ Jesus.
56002014	Faith	Who gave himself for us, so that he might make us free from all wrongdoing, and make for himself a people clean in heart and on fire with good works.
43005024	Faith	Truly I say to you, The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me, has eternal life; he will not be judged, but has come from death into life.
66021015	Description	And he who was talking with me had a gold measuring-rod to take the measure of the town, and of its doors, and its wall.
50003019	Sin	Whose end is destruction, whose god is the stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, whose minds are fixed on the things of the earth.
54003006	Sin	Not one newly taken into the church, for fear that, through his high opinion of himself, he may come into the same sin as the Evil One.
65001003	Recommendation	My loved ones, while my thoughts were full of a letter which I was going to send you about our common salvation, it was necessary for me to send you one requesting you with all my heart to go on fighting strongly for the faith which has been given to the saints once and for ever.
44004002	Description	Being greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and preaching Jesus as an example of the coming back from the dead.
66018005	Sin	For her sins have gone up even to heaven, and God has taken note of her evil-doing.
43004046	Description	So he came to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum.
45012011	Recommendation	Be not slow in your work, but be quick in spirit, as the Lord's servants;
60001008	Faith	To whom your love is given, though you have not seen him; and the faith which you have in him, though you do not see him now, gives you joy greater than words and full of glory:
62004013	Grace	And his Spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us.
43019029	Description	Now there was a vessel ready, full of bitter wine, and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth.
51001013	Grace	Who has made us free from the power of evil and given us a place in the kingdom of the Son of his love;
45016017	Recommendation	Now, it is my desire, brothers, that you will take note of those who are causing division and trouble among you, quite against the teaching which was given to you: and keep away from them.
45012007	Recommendation	Or the position of a Deacon of the church, let a man give himself to it; or he who has the power of teaching, let him make use of it;
43016023	Faith	And on that day you will put no questions to me. Truly I say to you, Whatever request you make to the Father, he will give it to you in my name.
66021019	Description	The bases of the wall of the town had ornaments of all sorts of beautiful stones. The first base was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
59004017	Sin	The man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.
66019005	Faith	And a voice came from the high seat, saying, Give praise to our God, all you his servants, small and great, in whom is the fear of him.
47005002	Faith	For in this we are crying in weariness, greatly desiring to be clothed with our house from heaven:
48006004	Recommendation	But let every man make test of his work, and then will his cause for glory be in himself only, and not in his neighbour.
46007036	Recommendation	But if, in any man's opinion, he is not doing what is right for his virgin, if she is past her best years, and there is need for it, let him do what seems right to him; it is no sin; let them be married.
43016002	Violence	They will put you out of the Synagogues: yes, the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing God's pleasure.
66015001	Description	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and strange; seven angels having the seven last punishments, for in them the wrath of God is complete.
43018023	Description	Jesus said in answer, If I have said anything evil, give witness to the evil: but if I said what is true, why do you give me blows?
50004003	Recommendation	And I make request to you, true helper in my work, to see to the needs of those women who took part with me in the good news, with Clement and the rest of my brother-workers whose names are in the book of life.
66016006	Sin	For they made the blood of saints and prophets come out like a stream, and blood have you given them for drink; which is their right reward.
45006002	Sin	In no way. How may we, who are dead to sin, be living in it any longer?
66017011	Violence	And the beast which was, and is not, is himself the eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes into destruction.
48004030	Recommendation	What then do the Writings say? Send away the servant-woman and her son; for the son of the servant-woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman.
54006009	Sin	But those who have a desire for wealth are falling into danger, and are taken as in a net by a number of foolish and damaging desires, through which men are overtaken by death and destruction.
66017016	Violence	And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will be turned against the evil woman, and will make her waste and uncovered, and will take her flesh for food, and will have her burned with fire.
46008003	Faith	But if anyone has love for God, God has knowledge of him.
45003009	Sin	What then? are we worse off than they? In no way: because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks are all under the power of sin;
44007041	Sin	And they made the image of a young ox in those days, and made an offering to it, and had joy in the work of their hands.
66009020	Sin	And the rest of the people, who were not put to death by these evils, were not turned from the works of their hands, but went on giving worship to evil spirits, and images of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which have no power of seeing or hearing or walking:
47005011	Faith	Having in mind, then, the fear of the Lord, we put these things before men, but God sees our hearts; and it is my hope that we may seem right in your eyes.
49002003	Sin	Among whom we all at one time were living in the pleasures of our flesh, giving way to the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and the punishment of God was waiting for us even as for the rest.
44002040	Recommendation	And with more such words he gave his witness, offering them salvation and saying, Come out from this evil generation.
45008013	Faith	For if you go in the way of the flesh, death will come on you; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body, you will have life.
45010011	Faith	Because it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed.
45001008	Faith	First of all, I give praise to my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because news of your faith has gone into all the world.
52001004	Faith	Being conscious, my brothers, dear to God, that you have been marked out by God's purpose;
60004008	Recommendation	And most of all be warm in your love for one another; because in love there is forgiveness for sins without number:
44027001	Description	And when the decision had been made that we were to go by sea to Italy, they gave Paul and certain other prisoners into the care of a captain named Julius, of the Augustan band.
66015003	Faith	And they give the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and full of wonder are your works, O Lord God, Ruler of all; true and full of righteousness are your ways, eternal King.
60002002	Faith	Be full of desire for the true milk of the word, as babies at their mothers' breasts, so that you may go on to salvation;
66014013	Faith	And a voice from heaven came to my ears, saying, Put in writing, There is a blessing on the dead who from now on come to their end in the Lord: yes, says the Spirit, that they may have rest from their troubles; for their works go with them.
59001027	Faith	The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep oneself untouched by the world.
51002004	Recommendation	I say this so that you may not be turned away by any deceit of words.
66005013	Description	And to my ears came the voice of everything in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and of all things which are in them, saying, To him who is seated on the high seat, and to the Lamb, may blessing and honour and glory and power be given for ever and ever.
66008008	Description	And at the sounding of the second angel, it was as if a great mountain burning with fire was sent into the sea: and a third part of the sea became blood,
44007058	Violence	Driving him out of the town and stoning him: and the witnesses put their clothing at the feet of a young man named Saul.
45015011	Faith	And again, Give praise to the Lord, all you Gentiles; and let all the nations give praise to him.
45011036	Faith	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. So be it.
43001029	Faith	The day after, John sees Jesus coming to him and says, See, here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
58011031	Description	By faith Rahab, the loose woman, was not put to death with those who had gone against God's orders, because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land.
43010010	Grace	The thief comes only to take the sheep and to put them to death: he comes for their destruction: I have come so that they may have life and have it in greater measure.
50003020	Faith	For our country is in heaven; from where the Saviour for whom we are waiting will come, even the Lord Jesus Christ:
45015007	Recommendation	So then, take one another to your hearts, as Christ took us, to the glory of God.
44021024	Recommendation	Go with these, and make yourself clean with them, and make the necessary payments for them, so that they may be free from their oath: and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true, but that you put yourself under rule, and keep the law.

59004009	Recommendation	Be troubled, with sorrow and weeping; let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief.
64001011	Recommendation	My loved one, do not be copying what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God: he who does evil has not seen God.
45004011	Faith	And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision: so that he might be the father of all those who have faith, though they have not circumcision, and so that righteousness might be put to their account;
45006007	Grace	Because he who is dead is free from sin.
47004010	Faith	In our bodies there is ever the mark of the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our bodies.
50002021	Sin	For they all go after what is theirs, not after the things of Christ.
58011011	Faith	And by faith Sarah herself had power to give birth, when she was very old, because she had faith in him who gave his word;
43006039	Grace	And this is the pleasure of him who sent me, that I am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me, but I am to give it new life on the last day.
46008006	Faith	There is for us only one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we are for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we have our being through him.
52003006	Description	But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has given us good news of your faith and love, and that you have happy memories of us, desiring greatly to see us, even as we do to see you;
60005004	Grace	And at the coming of the chief Keeper of the sheep, you will be given the eternal crown of glory.
47003012	Faith	Having then such a hope, we keep nothing back,
61002012	Sin	But these men, like beasts without reason, whose natural use is to be taken and put to death, crying out against things of which they have no knowledge, will undergo that same destruction which they are designing for others;
43012006	Sin	(He said this, not because he had any love for the poor; but because he was a thief, and, having the money-bag, took for himself what was put into it.)
62004016	Faith	And we have seen and had faith in the love which God has for us. God is love, and everyone who has love is in God, and God is in him.
44011019	Description	Then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus, preaching to the Jews only.
54006006	Faith	But true faith, with peace of mind, is of great profit:
66013007	Violence	And it was given to him to make war on the saints and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and language and nation.
60002020	Faith	What credit is it if, when you have done evil, you take your punishment quietly? but if you are given punishment for doing right, and take it quietly, this is pleasing to God.
58009015	Grace	And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being, so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death, the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage.
45006001	Sin	What may we say, then? are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace?
49005004	Recommendation	And let there be no low behaviour, or foolish talk, or words said in sport, which are not right, but in place of them the giving of praise.
66006008	Violence	And I saw a grey horse, and the name of him who was seated on it was Death; and Hell came after him. And there was given to them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to put to destruction by the sword, and by taking away their food, and by death, and by the beasts of the earth.
45004016	Faith	For this reason it is of faith, so that it may be through grace; and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
44028018	Description	Who, when they had put questions to me, were ready to let me go free, because there was no cause of death in me.
45009016	Grace	So then, it is not by the desire or by the attempt of man, but by the mercy of God.
46010008	Sin	Again, let us not give way to the desires of the flesh, as some of them did, of whom twenty-three thousand came to their end in one day.
45007023	Sin	But I see another law in my body, working against the law of my mind, and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh.
58006001	Faith	For this reason let us go on from the first things about Christ to full growth; not building again that on which it is based, that is, the turning of the heart from dead works, and faith in God,
46016011	Recommendation	See then that he has the honour which is right. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me: for I am looking for him with the brothers.
59002014	Faith	What use is it, my brothers, for a man to say that he has faith, if he does nothing? will such a faith give him salvation?
43007025	Description	Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the man whose death is desired?
43020022	Faith	And when he had said this, breathing on them, he said to them, Let the Holy Spirit come on you:
45010003	Sin	Because, not having knowledge of God's righteousness, and desiring to give effect to their righteousness, they have not put themselves under the righteousness of God.
62005010	Faith	He who has faith in the Son of God has the witness in himself: he who has not faith in God makes him false, because he has not faith in the witness which God has given about his Son.
43014012	Faith	Truly I say to you, He who puts his faith in me will do the very works which I do, and he will do greater things than these, because I am going to my Father.
56002009	Recommendation	Servants are to be under the authority of their masters, pleasing them in all things, without argument;
58012015	Recommendation	Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you, and that some of you may be made unclean by it;
54003007	Recommendation	And he is to have a good name among those outside the church, so that nothing may be said against him and he may not be taken by the designs of the Evil One.
49004007	Grace	But to every one of us has grace been given in the measure of the giving of Christ.
66016003	Description	And the second let what was in his vessel come out into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea came to an end.
49006006	Recommendation	Not only under your master's eye, as pleasers of men; but as servants of Christ, doing the pleasure of God from the heart;
60003016	Recommendation	Being conscious that you have done no wrong; so that those who say evil things about your good way of life as Christians may be put to shame.
43006040	Faith	This, I say, is my Father's pleasure, that everyone who sees the Son and has faith in him may have eternal life: and I will take him up on the last day.
44012023	Violence	And straight away the angel of the Lord sent a disease on him, because he did not give the glory to God: and his flesh was wasted away by worms, and so he came to his end.
47001003	Grace	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort;
54001006	Sin	From which some have been turned away, giving themselves to foolish talking;
45001016	Faith	For I have no feeling of shame about the good news, because it is the power of God giving salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first, and then to the Greek.
46003011	Description	For there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down, which is Jesus Christ.
49005033	Recommendation	But do you, everyone, have love for his wife, even as for himself; and let the wife see that she has respect for her husband.
51002013	Grace	And you, being dead through your sins and the evil condition of your flesh, to you, I say, he gave life together with him, and forgiveness of all our sins;
54004014	Recommendation	Make use of that grace in you, which was given to you by the word of the prophets, when the rulers of the church put their hands on you.
66021001	Description	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were gone; and there was no more sea.
52005016	Recommendation	Have joy at all times.
66009006	Description	And in those days men will be hoping for death, and it will not come to them; and they will have a great desire for death, and death will go in flight from them.
52004014	Faith	For if we have faith that Jesus underwent death and came back again, even so those who are sleeping will come again with him by God's power.
62004015	Faith	Everyone who says openly that Jesus is the Son of God, has God in him and is in God.
49004022	Recommendation	That you are to put away, in relation to your earlier way of life, the old man, which has become evil by love of deceit;
43010009	Grace	I am the door: if any man goes in through me he will have salvation, and will go in and go out, and will get food.
58011037	Violence	They were stoned, they were cut up with knives, they were tested, they were put to death with the sword, they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins; being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked,
62002029	Faith	If you have knowledge that he is upright, it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring.
44013047	Grace	For so the Lord has given us orders, saying, I have given you for a light to the Gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth.
47004002	Faith	And we have given up the secret things of shame, not walking in false ways, and not making use of the word of God with deceit; but by the revelation of what is true, as before God, we have the approval of every man's sense of right and wrong.
44002033	Description	And so, being lifted up to the right hand of God, and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come, he has sent this thing, which now you see and have knowledge of.
51003010	Recommendation	And have put on the new man, which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker;
43011004	Faith	When this came to his ears, Jesus said, The end of this disease is not death, but the glory of God, so that the Son of God may have glory because of it.
45001017	Faith	For in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of God from faith to faith: as it is said in the holy Writings, The man who does righteousness will be living by his faith.
43019017	Description	And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Man's Head (in Hebrew, Golgotha):
45012006	Faith	And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us, such as the quality of a prophet, let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith;
66004007	Description	And the first beast was like a lion, and the second like an ox, and the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.
49005015	Recommendation	Take care then how you are living, not as unwise, but as wise;
45010012	Grace	And the Jew is not different from the Greek: for there is the same Lord of all, who is good to all who have hope in his name:
45010004	Faith	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith.
50004006	Recommendation	Have no cares; but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before God.
46010006	Faith	Now these things were for an example to us, so that our hearts might not go after evil things, as they did.
66009002	Description	And he made the great deep open and a smoke went up from it, like the smoke of a great oven; and the sun and the air were made dark because of the smoke.
52004006	Recommendation	And that no man may make attempts to get the better of his brother in business: for the Lord is the judge in all these things, as we said to you before and gave witness.
47005017	Faith	So if any man is in Christ, he is in a new world: the old things have come to an end; they have truly become new.
43005020	Faith	For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does: and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder.
49004028	Recommendation	Let him who was a thief be so no longer, but let him do good work with his hands, so that he may have something to give to him who is in need.
57001022	Recommendation	And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.
58013009	Recommendation	Do not be turned away by different strange teachings, because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace, and not by meats, which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them.
52005012	Recommendation	But we make this request to you, my brothers: give attention to those who are working among you, who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you;
43009022	Description	They said this because of their fear of the Jews: for the Jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that Jesus was the Christ he would be put out of the Synagogue.
50003003	Faith	For we are the circumcision, who give worship to God and have glory in Jesus Christ, and have no faith in the flesh:
62003023	Faith	And this is his law, that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love for one another, even as he said to us.
66013011	Description	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and his voice was like that of a dragon.
46014020	Recommendation	My brothers, do not be children in mind: in evil be as little children, but in mind be of full growth.
59005013	Recommendation	Is anyone among you in trouble? let him say prayers. Is anyone glad? let him make a song of praise.
58012012	Recommendation	For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up, and let the feeble knees be made strong,
60001017	Recommendation	And if you give the name of Father to him who, judging every man by his acts, has no respect for a man's position, then go in fear while you are on this earth:
58010036	Recommendation	For, having done what was right in God's eyes, you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you.
58011001	Faith	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the sign that the things not seen are true.
49004017	Recommendation	This I say, then, and give witness in the Lord, that you are to go no longer in the way of the Gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit,
51002016	Recommendation	For this reason let no man be your judge in any question of food or drink or feast days or new moons or Sabbaths:
66007015	Faith	This is why they are before the high seat of God; and they are his servants day and night in his house: and he who is seated on the high seat will be a tent over them.
44020010	Description	And Paul went down and, falling on him, took him in his arms and said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.
55002010	Faith	But I undergo all things for the saints, so that they may have salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
60005014	Recommendation	Give one another the kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ.
49005021	Recommendation	Letting yourselves be ruled by one another in the fear of Christ.
61003017	Recommendation	For this reason, my loved ones, having knowledge of these things before they take place, take care that you are not turned away by the error of the uncontrolled, so falling from your true faith.
51003018	Recommendation	Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as is right in the Lord.
54005020	Recommendation	Say sharp words to sinners when all are present, so that the rest may be in fear.
45014013	Recommendation	Then let us not be judges of one another any longer: but keep this in mind, that no man is to make it hard for his brother, or give him cause for doubting.
45002010	Grace	But glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good, to the Jew first and then to the Greek:
58011034	Violence	Put out the power of fire, got safely away from the edge of the sword, were made strong when they had been feeble, became full of power in war, and put to flight the armies of the nations.
48006017	Faith	From this time on let no man be a trouble to me; because my body is marked with the marks of Jesus.
66018021	Violence	And a strong angel took up a stone like the great stone with which grain is crushed, and sent it into the sea, saying, So, with a great fall, will Babylon, the great town, come to destruction, and will not be seen any more at all.
65001020	Faith	But you, my loved ones, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, and making prayers in the Holy Spirit,
45012002	Recommendation	And let not your behaviour be like that of this world, but be changed and made new in mind, so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God.
46015009	Sin	For I am the least of the Apostles, having no right to be named an Apostle, because of my cruel attacks on the church of God.
62002015	Recommendation	Have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world. If any man has love for the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
45002001	Sin	So you have no reason, whoever you are, for judging: for in judging another you are judging yourself, for you do the same things.
48002009	Description	When they saw the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who had the name of being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;
43019023	Description	And when Jesus was nailed to the cross, the men of the army took his clothing, and made a division of it into four parts, to every man a part, and they took his coat: now the coat was without a join, made out of one bit of cloth.
45002021	Sin	You who give teaching to others, do you give it to yourself? you who say that a man may not take what is not his, do you take what is not yours?
46006019	Faith	Or are you not conscious that your body is a house for the Holy Spirit which is in you, and which has been given to you by God? and you are not the owners of yourselves;
47005014	Grace	For it is the love of Christ which is moving us; because we are of the opinion that if one was put to death for all, then all have undergone death;
58003001	Faith	For this reason, holy brothers, marked out to have a part in heaven, give thought to Jesus the representative and high priest of our faith;
44020035	Recommendation	In all things I was an example to you of how, in your lives, you are to give help to the feeble, and keep in memory the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, There is a greater blessing in giving than in getting.
58013004	Recommendation	Let married life be honoured among all of you and not made unclean; for men untrue in married life will be judged by God.
43020005	Description	And looking in, he saw the linen bands on the earth; but he did not go in,
66016018	Description	And there were flames and voices and thunders; and there was a great earth-shock so that never, from the time when men were on the earth, had there been so great an earth-shock, so full of power.
66019010	Faith	And I went on my face before his feet to give him worship. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am a brother-servant with you and with your brothers who keep the witness of Jesus: give worship to God: for the witness of Jesus is the spirit of the prophet's word.
46002010	Grace	But God has given us the revelation of these things through his Spirit, for the Spirit makes search into all things, even the deep things of God.
50002029	Recommendation	So take him to your hearts in the Lord with all joy, and give honour to such as he is:
51003020	Recommendation	Children, do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord.
47001012	Faith	For our glory is in this, in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world, and most of all in relation to you, has been holy and true in the eyes of God; not in the wisdom of the flesh, but in the grace of God.
43014021	Faith	He who has my laws and keeps them, he it is who has love for me: and he who has love for me will be loved by my Father, and I will have love for him and will let myself be seen clearly by him.
51002023	Sin	These things seem to have a sort of wisdom in self-ordered worship and making little of oneself, and being cruel to the body, not honouring it by giving it its natural use.
64001006	Recommendation	Who have given witness to the church of your love for them: and you will do well to send them on their way well cared for, as is right for servants of God:
55002023	Recommendation	And put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings, seeing that they are a cause of trouble.
47003018	Faith	But we all, with unveiled face giving back as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord who is the Spirit.
58009014	Grace	How much more will the blood of Christ, who, being without sin, made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit, make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God?
44011017	Grace	If then God gave them, when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the same as he gave to us, who was I to go against God?
49004030	Faith	And do not give grief to the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were marked for the day of salvation.
66003003	Recommendation	Keep in mind, then, the teaching which was given to you, and be ruled by it and have a change of heart. If then you do not keep watch, I will come like a thief, and you will have no knowledge of the hour when I will come on you.
62003007	Recommendation	My little children, let no man take you out of the true way: he who does righteousness is upright, even as he is upright;
62004001	Recommendation	My loved ones, do not put your faith in every spirit, but put them to the test, to see if they are from God: because a great number of false prophets have gone out into the world.
44013038	Grace	And so, let it be clear to you, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you:
50003001	Recommendation	For the rest, my brothers, be glad in the Lord. Writing the same things to you is no trouble to me, and for you it is safe.
46011034	Recommendation	If any man is in need of food, let him take his meal in his house; so that you may not come together to your damage. And the rest I will put in order when I come.
43018031	Description	Then Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law. But the Jews said to him, We have no right to put any man to death.
46012031	Faith	But let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the Spirit. And now I am pointing out to you an even better way.
58007026	Description	It was right for us to have such a high priest, one who is holy and without evil, doing no wrong, having no part with sinners, and made higher than the heavens:
50004013	Faith	I am able to do all things through him who gives me strength.
52004003	Recommendation	For the purpose of God for you is this: that you may be holy, and may keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh;
51004002	Recommendation	Give yourselves to prayer at all times, keeping watch with praise;
44007029	Description	And at these words, Moses went in flight to the land of Midian, and was living there for a time, and had two sons.
46011007	Description	For it is not right for a man to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
51003015	Faith	And let the peace of Christ be ruling in your hearts, as it was the purpose of God for you to be one body; and give praise to God at all times.
58002010	Grace	Because it was right for him, for whom and through whom all things have being, in guiding his sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain.
59004001	Sin	What is the cause of wars and fighting among you? is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies?
46005001	Sin	It is said, in fact, that there is among you a sin of the flesh, such as is not seen even among the Gentiles, that one of you has his father's wife.
46010013	Faith	You have been put to no test but such as is common to man: and God is true, who will not let any test come on you which you are not able to undergo; but he will make with the test a way out of it, so that you may be able to go through it.
44020029	Violence	I am conscious that after I am gone, evil wolves will come in among you, doing damage to the flock;
53001004	Faith	So that we ourselves take pride in you in the churches of God for your untroubled mind and your faith in all the troubles and sorrows which you are going through;
62004012	Faith	No man has ever seen God: if we have love for one another, God is in us and his love is made complete in us:
48001001	Description	Paul, an Apostle (not from men, and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who made him come back from the dead),
58012003	Recommendation	Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself, so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose.
45006005	Faith	For, if we have been made like him in his death, we will, in the same way, be like him in his coming to life again;
45015010	Recommendation	And again he says, Take part, you Gentiles, in the joy of his people.
54004001	Sin	But the Spirit says clearly that in later times some will be turned away from the faith, giving their minds to spirits of deceit, and the teachings of evil spirits,
56003001	Recommendation	Make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities, to do what they are ordered, to be ready for every good work,
61003005	Sin	But in taking this view they put out of their minds the memory that in the old days there was a heaven, and an earth lifted out of the water and circled by water, by the word of God;
60003018	Grace	Because Christ once went through pain for sins, the upright one taking the place of sinners, so that through him we might come back to God; being put to death in the flesh, but given life in the Spirit;
61002021	Sin	For it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness, than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them, after having knowledge of it.
53003006	Recommendation	Now we give you orders, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from all those whose behaviour is not well ordered and in harmony with the teaching which they had from us.
45005012	Sin	For this reason, as through one man sin came into the world, and death because of sin, and so death came to all men, because all have done evil:
58011033	Faith	Who through faith overcame kingdoms, did righteousness, got their reward, kept the mouths of lions shut,
47004009	Faith	We are cruelly attacked, but not without hope; we are made low, but we are not without help;
59004004	Sin	O you who are false to God, do you not see that the friends of this world are not God's friends? Every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of God.
44016006	Description	And after they had gone through the land of Phrygia and Galatia, the Holy Spirit did not let them take the word into Asia;
45010006	Faith	But the righteousness which is of faith says these words, Say not in your heart, Who will go up to heaven? (that is, to make Christ come down:)
66016002	Violence	And the first went, and let what was in his vessel come down on the earth; and it became an evil poisoning wound on the men who had the mark of the beast, and who gave worship to his image.
66005008	Description	And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and the four and twenty rulers went down on their faces before the Lamb, having every one an instrument of music, and gold vessels full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.
62005001	Faith	Everyone who has faith that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God: and everyone who has love for the Father has love for his child.
48005026	Recommendation	Let us not be full of self-glory, making one another angry, having envy of one another.
54005001	Recommendation	Do not say sharp words to one who has authority in the church, but let your talk be as to a father, and to the younger men as to brothers:
60002012	Recommendation	Being of good behaviour among the Gentiles; so that though they say now that you are evil-doers, they may see your good works and give glory to God when he comes to be their judge.
50003006	Sin	In bitter hate I was cruel to the church; I kept all the righteousness of the law to the last detail.
43004052	Description	So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better; and they said to him, The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour.
43019031	Violence	Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover, and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath (because the day of that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
43019012	Description	Hearing this, Pilate had a desire to let him go free, but the Jews said in a loud voice, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar.
43014001	Faith	Let not your heart be troubled: have faith in God and have faith in me.
50001028	Faith	Having no fear of those who are against you; which is a clear sign of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;
43015016	Grace	You did not take me for yourselves, but I took you for myself; and I gave you the work of going about and producing fruit which will be for ever; so that whatever request you make to the Father in my name he may give it to you.
58011004	Faith	By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain, and he had witness through it of his righteousness, God giving his approval of his offering: and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead.
46004001	Recommendation	Let us be judged as servants of Christ, and as those who are responsible for the secret things of God.
66006013	Description	And the stars of heaven were falling to the earth, like green fruit from a tree before the force of a great wind.
46010014	Recommendation	For this cause, my dear brothers, give no worship to false gods.
45012021	Recommendation	Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil by good.
55002014	Recommendation	Put these things before them, giving them orders in the name of the Lord to keep themselves from fighting about words, which is of no profit, only causing error in their hearers.
59004008	Recommendation	Come near to God and he will come near to you. Make your hands clean, you evil-doers; put away deceit from your hearts, you false in mind.
59002009	Sin	But if you take a man's position into account, you do evil, and are judged as evil-doers by the law.
52004007	Grace	Because it is God's purpose that our way of life may be not unclean but holy.
45001018	Sin	For there is a revelation of the wrath of God from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing;
62004007	Faith	My loved ones, let us have love for one another: because love is of God, and everyone who has love is a child of God and has knowledge of God.
62002009	Sin	He who says that he is in the light, and has hate in his heart for his brother, is still in the dark.
60004014	Grace	If men say evil things of you because of the name of Christ, happy are you; for the Spirit of glory and of God is resting on you.
44021019	Grace	And when he had said how glad he was to see them, he gave them a detailed account of the things which God had done through his work among the Gentiles.
43008046	Sin	Which of you is able truly to say that I am a sinner? If I say what is true, why have you no belief in me?
58010017	Grace	And I will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil-doings.
46001005	Grace	So that in him you have wealth in all things, in word and in knowledge of every sort;
45015030	Recommendation	Now I make request to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you will be working together with me in your prayers to God for me;
43007020	Violence	The people said in answer, You have an evil spirit: who has any desire to put you to death?
45003025	Grace	Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy, through faith, by his blood, to make clear his righteousness when, in his pity, God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment;
43018018	Description	Now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold; they were warming themselves in front of it and Peter was there with them, warming himself.
49006011	Recommendation	Take up God's instruments of war, so that you may be able to keep your position against all the deceits of the Evil One.
43013037	Faith	Peter said to him, Why may I not come with you even now? I will give up my life for you.
50004007	Faith	And the peace of God, which is deeper than all knowledge, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
59003009	Faith	With it we give praise to our Lord and Father; and with it we put a curse on men who are made in God's image.
46005010	Sin	But I had not in mind the sinners who are outside the church, or those who have a desire for and take the property of others, or those who give worship to images; for it is not possible to keep away from such people without going out of the world completely:
44026009	Sin	For I, truly, was of the opinion that it was right for me to do a number of things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
61002014	Sin	Having eyes full of evil desire, never having enough of sin; turning feeble souls out of the true way; they are children of cursing, whose hearts are well used to bitter envy;
43010012	Description	He who is a servant, and not the keeper or the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming and goes in flight, away from the sheep; and the wolf comes down on them and sends them in all directions:
59001019	Recommendation	You have knowledge of this, dear brothers. But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to get angry;
46009014	Recommendation	Even so did the Lord give orders that the preachers of the good news might get their living from the good news.
43012046	Grace	I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark.
43005014	Description	After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him, See, you are well and strong; do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you.
46016014	Recommendation	Let all you do be done in love.
43014015	Recommendation	If you have love for me, you will keep my laws.
58012025	Recommendation	See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you. For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment, what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven?
48004008	Sin	But at that time, having no knowledge of God, you were servants to those who by right are no gods:
44003026	Grace	To you, first, God sent his servant, blessing you by turning every one of you from his sins.
44010039	Violence	And we are witnesses of all the things which he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they put to death, hanging him on a tree.
46001010	Recommendation	Now I make request to you, my brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you will all say the same thing, and that there may be no divisions among you, so that you may be in complete agreement, in the same mind and in the same opinion.
51001021	Sin	And you, who in the past were cut off and at war with God in your minds through evil works, he has now made one
55002022	Recommendation	But keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young, and go after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those whose prayers go up to the Lord from a clean heart.
51003001	Faith	If then you have a new life with Christ, give your attention to the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
66008007	Violence	And at the sounding of the first, a rain of ice and fire, mixed with blood, was sent on the earth: and a third part of the earth, and of the trees, and all green grass was burned up.
66011017	Faith	We give you praise, O Lord God, Ruler of all, who is and who was; because you have taken up your great power and are ruling your kingdom.
43004010	Grace	In answer Jesus said, If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you, Give me water, you would make your prayer to him, and he would give you living water.
51003004	Grace	At the coming of Christ who is our life, you will be seen with him in glory.
43020031	Faith	But these are recorded, so that you may have faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that, having this faith you may have life in his name.
62004006	Faith	We are of God: he who has the knowledge of God gives ear to us; he who is not of God does not give ear to us. By this we may see which is the true spirit, and which is the spirit of error.
65001012	Description	These men are unseen rocks at your love-feasts, when they take part in them with you, keepers of sheep who without fear take the food of the sheep; clouds without water rushing before the wind, wasted trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots,
44005015	Description	And they even took into the streets people who were ill, and put them on beds, so that when Peter went by, some of them might be in his shade.
49006016	Faith	And most of all, using faith as a cover to keep off all the flaming arrows of the Evil One.
51003023	Recommendation	Whatever you do, do it readily, as to the Lord and not to men;
58012016	Recommendation	And that there may not be any evil liver, or any man without respect for God, like Esau, who let his birthright go for a plate of food.
43018040	Sin	Then again they gave a loud cry, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was an outlaw.
55003004	Sin	False to their friends, acting without thought, lifted up in mind, loving pleasure more than God;
50002009	Grace	For this reason God has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name;
61001016	Description	For when we gave you news of the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, our teaching was not based on stories put together by art, but we were eye-witnesses of his glory.
61003016	Sin	And as he said in all his letters, which had to do with these things; in which are some hard sayings, so that, like the rest of the holy Writings, they are twisted by those who are uncertain and without knowledge, to the destruction of their souls.
44014014	Description	But when this came to the ears of the Apostles, Paul and Barnabas, they went running out among the people, parting their clothing, and crying out,
45015008	Faith	Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by God to the fathers,
59001026	Sin	If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false, this man's religion is of no value.
43015020	Recommendation	Keep in mind the words I said to you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they were cruel to me, they will be cruel to you; if they kept my words, they will keep yours.
43008031	Faith	Then Jesus said to the Jews who had faith in him, If you keep my word, then you are truly my disciples;
44007011	Description	Now there was no food to be had in all Egypt and Canaan, and there was great trouble: and our fathers were not able to get food.
63001004	Faith	It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way, even as we were ordered to do by the Father.
54005008	Faith	If anyone has no care for his family and those in his house, he is false to the faith, and is worse than one who has no faith.
58010022	Faith	Let us go in with true hearts, in certain faith, having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water:
48001023	Description	Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him;
44027034	Recommendation	So I make request to you to take food; for this is for your salvation: not a hair from the head of any of you will come to destruction.
66002003	Faith	And you have the power of waiting, and have undergone trouble because of my name, without weariness.
56002002	Recommendation	That old men are to be simple in their tastes, serious, wise, true in faith, in love, and of a quiet mind.
44017030	Recommendation	Those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by God; but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart:
43019025	Description	Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
66019013	Description	And he is clothed in a robe washed with blood: and his name is The Word of God.
46008009	Recommendation	But take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble.
44013034	Grace	And about his coming back from the dead, never again to go to destruction, he has said these words, I will give you the holy and certain mercies of David.
43014020	Faith	At that time it will be clear to you that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I in you.
62002003	Faith	And by this we may be certain that we have knowledge of him, if we keep his laws.
43008024	Sin	For this reason I said to you that death will overtake you in your sins: for if you have not faith that I am he, death will come to you while you are in your sins.
66017006	Sin	And I saw the woman overcome as with the wine of the blood of the saints, and the blood of those put to death because of Jesus. And when I saw her, I was overcome with a great wonder.
58012017	Description	For you have knowledge that even long after, when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage, he was turned away, though he made his request frequently and with weeping; because the past might not be changed.
43007012	Description	And there was much discussion about him among the mass of the people. Some said, He is a good man; but others said, No, he is giving people false ideas.
44011021	Faith	And the power of the Lord was with them, and a great number had faith and were turned to the Lord.
52002004	Faith	But even as the good news was given to us by the approval of God, so we give it out; not as pleasing men, but God by whom our hearts are tested.
46015057	Grace	But praise be to God who gives us strength to overcome through our Lord Jesus Christ.
54005005	Faith	Now she who is truly a widow and without family puts her hope in God, giving herself to prayer day and night.
43016024	Grace	Up to now you have made no request in my name: do so, and it will be answered, so that your hearts may be full of joy.
46007021	Recommendation	If you were a servant when you became a Christian, let it not be a grief to you; but if you have a chance to become free, make use of it.
65001019	Sin	These are the men who make divisions, natural men, not having the Spirit.
48001006	Sin	I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort;
58012014	Recommendation	Let your desire be for peace with all men, and to be made holy, without which no man may see the Lord;
43021006	Description	And he said to them, Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some. So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish.
46007019	Recommendation	Circumcision is nothing, and its opposite is nothing, but only doing the orders of God is of value.
45012008	Recommendation	He who has the power of comforting, let him do so; he who gives, let him give freely; he who has the power of ruling, let him do it with a serious mind; he who has mercy on others, let it be with joy.
44019002	Faith	And he said to them, Did you get the Holy Spirit when you had faith? And they said to him, No, we have had no knowledge of the Holy Spirit.
53003014	Recommendation	And if any man does not give attention to what we have said in this letter, take note of that man, and keep away from him, so that he may be shamed.
46015050	Sin	Now I say this, my brothers, that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God; and death may not have a part in life.
43006027	Recommendation	Let your work not be for the food which comes to an end, but for the food which goes on for eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for on him has God the Father put his mark.
59004003	Sin	You make your request but you do not get it, because your request has been wrongly made, desiring the thing only so that you may make use of it for your pleasure.
49005020	Faith	Giving praise at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;
48003006	Faith	Even as Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness.
66021023	Grace	And the town has no need of the sun, or of the moon, to give it light: for the glory of God did make it light, and the light of it is the Lamb.
45008009	Faith	You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God is in you. But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his.
45011023	Faith	And they, if they do not go on without faith, will be united to the tree again, because God is able to put them in again.
66014005	Description	And in their mouth there was no false word, for they are untouched by evil.
44024014	Faith	But this I will say openly to you, that I do give worship to the God of our fathers after that Way, which to them is not the true religion: but I have belief in all the things which are in the law and in the books of the prophets:
45013008	Recommendation	Be in debt for nothing, but to have love for one another: for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law.
66016009	Sin	And men were burned with great heat: and they said evil things against the name of the God who has authority over these punishments; and they were not turned from their evil ways to give him glory.
66021012	Description	She had a wall great and high, with twelve doors, and at the doors twelve angels; and names on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
48003013	Grace	Christ has made us free from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: because it is said in the Writings, A curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree:
48001013	Sin	For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews' religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it:
66020002	Description	And he took the dragon, the old snake, which is the Evil One and Satan, and put chains on him for a thousand years,
44008009	Description	But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man:
50003010	Faith	That I may have knowledge of him, and of the power of his coming back from the dead, and a part with him in his pains, becoming like him in his death;
54005022	Recommendation	Do not put hands on any man without thought, and have no part in other men's sins: keep yourself clean.
56002003	Recommendation	That old women are to be self-respecting in behaviour, not saying evil of others, not given to taking much wine, teachers of that which is good,
46007038	Recommendation	So then, he who gets married to his virgin does well, and he who keeps her unmarried does better.
59001022	Recommendation	But be doers of the word, and not only hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas.
43007001	Violence	After this, Jesus went from place to place in Galilee. He did not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were looking for a chance to put him to death.
46001030	Grace	But God has given you a place in Christ Jesus, through whom God has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation, and made us holy:
43013005	Description	Then he put water into a basin and was washing the feet of the disciples and drying them with the cloth which was round him.
44022004	Violence	And I made attacks on this Way, even to death, taking men and women and putting them in prison.
43007043	Description	So there was a division among the people because of him.
60005002	Recommendation	Keep watch over the flock of God which is in your care, using your authority, not as forced to do so, but gladly; and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind;
46015056	Sin	The pain of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:
59005004	Sin	See, the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field, is crying out against you; and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the Lord of armies.
60002001	Recommendation	So putting away all wrongdoing, and all tricks and deceits and envies and evil talk,
46007039	Recommendation	It is right for a wife to be with her husband as long as he is living; but when her husband is dead, she is free to be married to another; but only to a Christian.
55002018	Sin	Men whose ideas are all false, who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place, overturning the faith of some.
48005006	Faith	Because in Christ Jesus, having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit; but only faith working through love.
58005009	Grace	And when he had been made complete, he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders;
46016001	Recommendation	Now about the giving of money for the saints, as I gave orders to the churches of Galatia, so do you.
49005022	Recommendation	Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as of the Lord.
43008012	Faith	Then again Jesus said to them, I am the light of the world; he who comes with me will not be walking in the dark but will have the light of life.
65001017	Recommendation	But you, my loved ones, keep in memory the words which were said before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
44017025	Grace	And he is not dependent on the work of men's hands, as if he had need of anything, for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things;
62005009	Faith	If we take the witness of men to be true, the witness of God is greater: because this is the witness which God has given about his Son.
45013014	Faith	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires.
58011030	Description	By faith the walls of Jericho came down, after they had been circled for seven days.
44019011	Grace	And God did special works of power by the hands of Paul:
43008034	Sin	And this was the answer Jesus gave them: Truly I say to you, Everyone who does evil is the servant of sin.
62004011	Faith	My loved ones, if God had such love for us, it is right for us to have love for one another.
44002028	Grace	You have made me see the ways of life; I will be full of joy when I see your face.
54004013	Recommendation	Till I come, give attention to the reading of the holy Writings, to comforting the saints, and to teaching.
47004008	Description	Troubles are round us on every side, but we are not shut in; things are hard for us, but we see a way out of them;
44002013	Description	But others, making sport of them, said, They are full of new wine.
66021018	Description	And the building of its wall was of jasper, and the town was clear gold, clear as glass.
66015006	Description	And the seven angels who had the seven punishments came out from the house of God, clothed with linen, clean and bright and with bands of gold about their breasts.
45012014	Recommendation	Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you.
66001015	Description	And his feet like polished brass, as if it had been burned in a fire; and his voice was as the sound of great waters.
43017026	Grace	And I have given to them knowledge of your name, and will give it, so that the love which you have for me may be in them and I in them.
45008032	Grace	He who did not keep back his only Son, but gave him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all things?
65001018	Sin	How they said to you, In the last days there will be men who, guided by their evil desires, will make sport of holy things.
45011018	Recommendation	Do not be uplifted in pride over the branches: because it is not you who are the support of the root, but it is by the root that you are supported.
47001024	Faith	Not that we have authority over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy: for it is faith which is your support.
43011001	Description	Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill; he was of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
52004008	Sin	Whoever, then, goes against this word, goes against not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
62004002	Faith	By this you may have knowledge of the Spirit of God: every spirit which says that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God:
65001008	Sin	In the same way these dreamers make the flesh unclean, having no respect for authorities, and say evil of rulers.
60003011	Recommendation	And let him be turned from evil and do good; searching for peace and going after it with all his heart.
51001023	Faith	If you keep yourselves safely based in the faith, not moved from the hope of the good news which came to you, and which was given to every living being under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.
43008059	Violence	So they took up stones to send at him: but Jesus got secretly out of their way and went out of the Temple.
49004024	Recommendation	And put on the new man, to which God has given life, in righteousness and a true and holy way of living.
66014012	Faith	Here is the quiet strength of the saints, who keep the orders of God, and the faith of Jesus.
44013030	Description	But God gave him back from the dead:
43010011	Description	I am the good keeper of sheep: the good keeper gives his life for the sheep.
49003002	Grace	If that ordering of the grace of God has come to your knowledge, which was given to me for you,
56003010	Recommendation	A man whose opinions are not those of the church, after a first and second protest, is to be kept out of your society;
43010019	Description	There was a division again among the Jews because of these words.
43003033	Faith	He who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that God is true.
61003014	Recommendation	For this reason, my loved ones, as you are looking for these things, take great care that when he comes you may be in peace before him, free from sin and every evil thing.
53003001	Faith	For the rest, my brothers, let there be prayer for us that the word of the Lord may go forward with increasing glory, even as it does with you;
47004014	Faith	Because we are certain that he who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead, will do the same for us, and will give us a place in his glory with you.
59005014	Recommendation	Is anyone among you ill? let him send for the rulers of the church; and let them say prayers over him, putting oil on him in the name of the Lord.
44007023	Description	But when he was almost forty years old, it came into his heart to go and see his brothers, the children of Israel.
44023027	Violence	This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be put to death by them, when I came on them with the army and took him out of danger, having knowledge that he was a Roman.
44019029	Description	And the town was full of noise and trouble, and they all came running into the theatre, having taken by force Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia who were journeying in company with Paul.
44003014	Sin	But you would have nothing to do with the Holy and Upright One, and made request for a man of blood to be given to you,
44015009	Faith	Making no division between them and us, but making clean their hearts by faith.
46011028	Recommendation	But let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself.
46015058	Faith	For this cause, my dear brothers, be strong in purpose and unmoved, ever giving yourselves to the work of the Lord, because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the Lord.
46004016	Recommendation	So my desire is that you take me as your example.
46001021	Faith	For because, by the purpose of God, the world, with all its wisdom, had not the knowledge of God, it was God's pleasure, by so foolish a thing as preaching, to give salvation to those who had faith in him.
60003001	Recommendation	Wives, be ruled by your husbands; so that even if some of them give no attention to the word, their hearts may be changed by the behaviour of their wives,
47005020	Recommendation	So we are the representatives of Christ, as if God was making a request to you through us: we make our request to you, in the name of Christ, be at peace with God.
44002024	Description	But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it.
59002007	Sin	Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you?
54003003	Description	Not quickly moved to wrath or blows, but gentle; no fighter, no lover of money;
43004014	Grace	But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again; for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life.
62002005	Faith	But in every man who keeps his word, the love of God is made complete. By this we may be certain that we are in him:
66016013	Description	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, like frogs.
59002008	Recommendation	But if you keep the greatest law of all, as it is given in the holy Writings, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself, you do well:
47004005	Faith	For our preaching is not about ourselves, but about Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants through Jesus.
46015033	Recommendation	Do not be tricked by false words: evil company does damage to good behaviour.
58013020	Grace	Now may the God of peace, who made that great keeper of his flock, even our Lord Jesus, come back from the dead through the blood of the eternal agreement,
50001027	Recommendation	Only let your behaviour do credit to the good news of Christ, so that if I come and see you or if I am away from you, I may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit, working together with one soul for the faith of the good news;
46006014	Grace	And God who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us by his power.
55001006	Recommendation	For this reason I say to you, Let that grace of God which is in you, given to you by my hands, have living power.
60004006	Grace	For this was the reason why the good news of Jesus was given even to the dead, so that they might be judged as men in the flesh, but might be living before God in the spirit.
46007023	Recommendation	It is the Lord who has made payment for you: be not servants of men.
46010010	Recommendation	And do not say evil things against the Lord, as some of them did, and destruction overtook them.
47002017	Faith	For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit: but our words are true, as from God, being said as before God in Christ.
45015001	Recommendation	We who are strong have to be a support to the feeble, and not give pleasure to ourselves.
50002024	Faith	But I have faith in the Lord that I myself will come before long.
66007001	Description	After this I saw four angels in their places at the four points of the earth, keeping back the four winds in their hands, so that there might be no moving of the wind on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.
60004003	Sin	Because for long enough, in times past, we have been living after the way of the Gentiles, given up to the desires of the flesh, to drinking and feasting and loose behaviour and unclean worship of images;
66011005	Violence	And if any man would do them damage, fire comes out of their mouth and puts an end to those who are working against them: and if any man has a desire to do them damage, in this way will he be put to death.
44023005	Recommendation	And Paul said, Brother, I had no idea that he was the high priest: for it has been said, You may not say evil about the ruler of your people.
66022015	Sin	Outside are the dogs, and those who make use of evil powers, those who make themselves unclean, and the takers of life, and those who give worship to images, and everyone whose delight is in what is false.
66002014	Sin	But I have some things against you, because you have with you those who keep the teaching of Balaam, by whose suggestion Balak made the children of Israel go out of the right way, taking food which was offered to false gods, and going after the desires of the flesh.
53001003	Faith	It is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you, brothers, because of the great increase of your faith, and the wealth of your love for one another;
46012002	Sin	You are conscious that when you were Gentiles, in whatever way you were guided, you went after images without voice or power.
49005025	Recommendation	Husbands, have love for your wives, even as Christ had love for the church, and gave himself for it;
45012017	Recommendation	Do not give evil for evil to any man. Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men.
60005006	Recommendation	For this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of God, so that when the time comes you may be lifted up;
44014017	Grace	But he was not without witness, because he did good, and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit, making your hearts full of food and joy.
54003011	Recommendation	Women are to be serious in behaviour, saying no evil of others, controlling themselves, true in all things.
66002021	Sin	And I gave her time for a change of heart, but she has no mind to give up her unclean ways.
44012020	Description	Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon: and they came to him, all together, and having made friends with Blastus, the controller of the king's house, they made a request for peace, because their country was dependent on the king's country for its food.
43008049	Sin	And this was the answer of Jesus: I have not an evil spirit; but I give honour to my Father and you do not give honour to me.
43006018	Description	The sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing.
45008018	Faith	I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future.
62002012	Grace	I am writing to you, my children, because you have forgiveness of sins through his name.
55001009	Grace	Who gave us salvation, marking us out for his purpose, not on account of our works, but in the measure of his purpose and his grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
43019006	Violence	So when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry, To the cross! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and put him on the cross: I see no crime in him.
60001010	Grace	For the prophets who gave the news of the grace which would come to you, made search with all care for knowledge of this salvation;
63001007	Sin	Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist.
44024005	Sin	For this man, in our opinion, is a cause of trouble, a maker of attacks on the government among Jews through all the empire, and a chief mover in the society of the Nazarenes:
54003016	Grace	And without argument, great is the secret of religion: He who was seen in the flesh, who was given God's approval in the spirit, was seen by the angels, of whom the good news was given among the nations, in whom the world had faith, who was taken up in glory.
66016021	Violence	And great drops of ice, every one about the weight of a talent, came down out of heaven on men: and men said evil things against God because of the punishment of the ice-drops; for it is very great.
61003013	Faith	But having faith in his word, we are looking for a new heaven and a new earth, which will be the resting-place of righteousness.
66006014	Description	And the heaven was taken away like the roll of a book when it is rolled up; and all the mountains and islands were moved out of their places.
58010010	Grace	By that pleasure we have been made holy, by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever.
52001002	Faith	We give praise to God at all times for you, keeping you in memory in our prayers;
66006004	Violence	And another horse came out, a red horse; and it was given to him who was seated on it to take peace from the earth, so that people might put one another to death: and there was given to him a great sword.
54006001	Recommendation	Let all who are servants under the yoke give all honour to their masters, so that no evil may be said against the name of God and his teaching.
51003009	Recommendation	Do not make false statements to one another; because you have put away the old man with all his doings,
66002020	Sin	But I have this against you, that you let the woman Jezebel say she is a prophet and give false teaching, making my servants go after the desires of the flesh and take food offered to false gods.
48003008	Grace	And the holy Writings, seeing before the event that God would give the Gentiles righteousness by faith, gave the good news before to Abraham, saying, In you will all the nations have a blessing.
58012005	Recommendation	And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons, My son, do not make little of the Lord's punishment, and do not give up hope when you are judged by him;
58013017	Recommendation	Give ear to those who are rulers over you, and do as they say: for they keep watch over your souls, ready to give an account of them; let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief, because that would be of no profit to you.
44013019	Description	And having put to destruction seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years.
54006003	Faith	If any man gives different teaching, not in agreement with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the teaching which is in agreement with true religion,
63001010	Recommendation	If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love:
47001005	Grace	For as we undergo more of the pain which Christ underwent, so through Christ does our comfort become greater.
65001011	Sin	A curse on them! They have gone in the way of Cain, running uncontrolled into the error of Balaam for reward, and have come to destruction by saying evil against the Lord, like Korah.
65001010	Sin	But these men say evil about such things as they have no knowledge of; and the things of which they have natural knowledge, like beasts without reason, are the cause of their destruction.
58011007	Faith	By faith Noah, being moved by the fear of God, made ready an ark for the salvation of his family, because God had given him news of things which were not seen at the time; and through it the world was judged by him, and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith.
58009006	Description	Now while these things were in existence, the priests went into the first Tent at all times, for prayer and the making of offerings.
44007051	Sin	You whose hearts are hard and whose ears are shut to me; you are ever working against the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.
54001009	Sin	With the knowledge that the law is made, not for the upright man, but for those who have no respect for law and order, for evil men and sinners, for the unholy and those who have no religion, for those who put their fathers or mothers to death, for takers of life,
46005009	Recommendation	In my letter I said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh;
48001015	Grace	But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body, through his grace,
45007015	Description	And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do.
61003018	Faith	But be increased in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. May he have glory now and for ever. So be it.
46004010	Description	We are made to seem foolish for Christ, but you are wise in Christ; we are feeble, but you are strong; you have glory, but we have shame.
60005009	Faith	Do not give way to him but be strong in your faith, in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles.
51003022	Recommendation	Servants, in all things do the orders of your natural masters; not only when their eyes are on you, as pleasers of men, but with all your heart, fearing the Lord:
66017012	Description	And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which still have been given no kingdom; but they are given authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.
46002012	Grace	But we have not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes from God, so that we may have knowledge of the things which are freely given to us by God.
59005001	Recommendation	Come now, you men of wealth, give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you.
66002010	Recommendation	Have no fear of the things which you will have to undergo: see, the Evil One will send some of you into prison, so that you may be put to the test; and you will have great trouble for ten days. Be true till death, and I will give you the crown of life.
54006011	Recommendation	But you, O man of God, keep yourself from these things, and go after righteousness, religion, faith, love, a quiet mind, gentle behaviour.
59005005	Sin	You have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure; you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction.
66004004	Description	And round about the high seat were four and twenty seats: and on them I saw four and twenty rulers seated, clothed in white robes; and on their heads crowns of gold.
66018007	Description	As she gave glory to herself, and became more evil in her ways, in the same measure give her pain and weeping: for she says in her heart, I am seated here a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see sorrow.
60003007	Recommendation	And you husbands, give thought to your way of life with your wives, giving honour to the woman who is the feebler vessel, but who has an equal part in the heritage of the grace of life; so that you may not be kept from prayer.
54002012	Recommendation	In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher, or to have rule over a man, but to be quiet.
46001009	Faith	God is true, through whom you have been given a part with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
48005013	Recommendation	Because you, brothers, were marked out to be free; only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance, but through love be servants one to another.
59002012	Recommendation	Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free.
46012005	Faith	And there are different sorts of servants, but the same Lord.
45009005	Description	Whose are the fathers, and of whom came Christ in the flesh, who is over all, God, to whom be blessing for ever. So be it.
47001006	Description	But if we are troubled, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo:
47001021	Faith	Now he who makes our faith strong together with you, in Christ, and has given us of his grace, is God;
44010015	Recommendation	And the voice came to him a second time, What God has made clean, do not you make common.
66018009	Sin	And the kings of the earth, who made themselves unclean with her, and in her company gave themselves up to evil, will be weeping and crying over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,
43014023	Faith	Jesus said to him in answer, If anyone has love for me, he will keep my words: and he will be dear to my Father; and we will come to him and make our living-place with him.
62004010	Grace	And this is love, not that we had love for God, but that he had love for us, and sent his Son to be an offering for our sins.
62001007	Faith	But if we are walking in the light, as he is in the light, we are all united with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son makes us clean from all sin.
48004007	Grace	So that you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then the heritage of God is yours.
58001008	Faith	But of the Son he says, Your seat of power, O God, is for ever and ever; and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of righteousness.
43010033	Sin	This was their answer: We are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words; because being a man you make yourself God.
66014011	Description	And the smoke of their pain goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, who give worship to the beast and his image, and have on them the mark of his name.
47004001	Faith	For this reason, because we have been made servants of this new order, through the mercy given to us, we are strong:
58013006	Faith	So that we say with a good heart, The Lord is my helper; I will have no fear: what is man able to do to me?
45014003	Recommendation	Let not him who takes food have a low opinion of him who does not: and let not him who does not take food be a judge of him who does; for he has God's approval.
45015005	Grace	Now may the God who gives comfort and strength in waiting make you of the same mind with one another in harmony with Christ Jesus:
58007027	Description	Who has no need to make offerings for sins every day, like those high priests, first for himself, and then for the people; because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself.
62003017	Sin	But if a man has this world's goods, and sees that his brother is in need, and keeps his heart shut against his brother, how is it possible for the love of God to be in him?
47005008	Faith	We are without fear, desiring to be free from the body, and to be with the Lord.
60002011	Recommendation	My loved ones, I make this request with all my heart, that, as those for whom this world is a strange country, you will keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh which make war against the soul;
60002017	Recommendation	Have respect for all, loving the brothers, fearing God, honouring the king.
44007025	Description	And he was hoping that his brothers would see that God had sent him to be their saviour; but they did not see.
50003002	Violence	Be on the watch against dogs, against the workers of evil, against those of the circumcision:
56001016	Sin	They say that they have knowledge of God, while by their acts they are turning their backs on him; they are hated by all, hard-hearted, and judged to be without value for any good work.
45010002	Faith	For I give witness of them that they have a strong desire for God, but not with knowledge.
47001004	Grace	Who gives us comfort in all our troubles, so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
55002015	Recommendation	Let it be your care to get the approval of God, as a workman who has no cause for shame, giving the true word in the right way.
53002004	Description	Who puts himself against all authority, lifting himself up over all which is named God or is given worship; so that he takes his seat in the Temple of God, putting himself forward as God.
49006004	Recommendation	And, you fathers, do not make your children angry: but give them training in the teaching and fear of the Lord.
45008037	Grace	But we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love.
44026014	Violence	And when we had all gone down on the earth, a voice came to me, saying in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me so cruelly? It is hard for you to go against the impulse which is driving you.
66002009	Sin	I have knowledge of your troubles and how poor you are (but you have true wealth), and the evil words of those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are a Synagogue of Satan.
46013006	Faith	It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing, but has joy in what is true;
59001021	Recommendation	For this reason, putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation.
46003006	Grace	I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God gave the increase.
66014008	Sin	And a second angel came after, saying, Destruction has come to Babylon the great, which gave to all the nations the wine of the wrath of her evil ways.
43015014	Recommendation	You are my friends, if you do what I give you orders to do.
62005021	Recommendation	My little children, keep yourselves from false gods.
55003006	Sin	For these are they who go secretly into houses, making prisoners of foolish women, weighted down with sin, turned from the way by their evil desires,
49004015	Faith	But saying true words in love, may come to full growth in him, who is the head, even Christ;
49004003	Faith	Taking care to keep the harmony of the Spirit in the yoke of peace.
44009005	Description	And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are attacking:
60003015	Recommendation	But give honour to Christ in your hearts as your Lord; and be ready at any time when you are questioned about the hope which is in you, to give an answer in the fear of the Lord and without pride;
44007033	Recommendation	And the Lord said, Take off the shoes from your feet, for the place where you are is holy.
62002024	Faith	But as for you, keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first. If you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the Father and the Son.
43008051	Faith	Truly I say to you, If a man keeps my word he will never see death.
66020011	Description	And I saw a great white seat, and him who was seated on it, before whose face the earth and the heaven went in flight; and there was no place for them.
46006013	Recommendation	Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will put an end to them together. But the body is not for the desires of the flesh, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:
45006011	Faith	Even so see yourselves as dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.
47002014	Faith	But praise be to God who makes us strong to overcome in Christ, and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him.
62001005	Grace	This is the word which came to us from him and which we give to you, that God is light and in him there is nothing dark.
43006037	Grace	Whatever the Father gives to me will come to me; and I will not send away anyone who comes to me.
58013001	Recommendation	Go on loving your brothers in the faith.
58007025	Grace	So that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to God through him, because he is ever living to make prayer to God for them.
43019015	Violence	Then they gave a loud cry, Away with him! away with him! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Am I to put your King to death on the cross? The chief priests said in answer, We have no king but Caesar.
45011005	Grace	In the same way, there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace.
66017002	Sin	With whom the kings of the earth made themselves unclean, and those who are on the earth were full of the wine of her evil desires.
45012010	Recommendation	Be kind to one another with a brother's love, putting others before yourselves in honour;
45008014	Faith	And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
66012003	Description	And there was seen another sign in heaven; a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.
45008017	Faith	And if we are children, we have a right to a part in the heritage; a part in the things of God, together with Christ; so that if we have a part in his pain, we will in the same way have a part in his glory.
54005017	Recommendation	Let rulers whose rule is good be honoured twice over, specially those whose work is preaching and teaching.
46008007	Sin	Still, all men have not that knowledge: but some, being used till now to the image, are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image; and because they are not strong in the faith, their minds are troubled.
43015002	Grace	He takes away every branch in me which has no fruit, and every branch which has fruit he makes clean, so that it may have more fruit.
60005003	Recommendation	Not as lords over God's heritage, but making yourselves examples to the flock.
52004013	Recommendation	But it is our desire, brothers, that you may be certain about those who are sleeping; so that you may have no need for sorrow, as others have who are without hope.
58011029	Description	By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it had been dry land, though the Egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same.
44007020	Description	At which time Moses came to birth, and he was very beautiful; and he was kept for three months in his father's house:
58005002	Grace	He is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way, because he himself is feeble;
45013012	Recommendation	The night is far gone, and the day is near: so let us put off the works of the dark, arming ourselves with light,
49006009	Recommendation	And, you masters, do the same things to them, not making use of violent words: in the knowledge that their Master and yours is in heaven, and he has no respect for a man's position.
45012015	Recommendation	Take part in the joy of those who are glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing.
45002005	Sin	But by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of God's judging in righteousness;
44014019	Violence	But some Jews came to that place from Antioch and Iconium, and got control over the people; and after stoning Paul, they had him pulled out of the town, taking him for dead.
43013021	Description	When Jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit, and gave witness, saying, Truly I say to you, that one of you will be false to me.
48003022	Faith	However, the holy Writings have put all things under sin, so that that for which God gave the undertaking, based on faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who have such faith.
66011007	Violence	And when they have come to the end of their witness, the beast which comes up out of the great deep will make war on them and overcome them and put them to death.
58003014	Faith	For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start, even till the end, we have a part with Christ;
45008010	Faith	And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
44007052	Sin	Which of the prophets was not cruelly attacked by your fathers? and they put to death those who gave them the news of the coming of the Upright One; whom you have now given up and put to death;
48005021	Sin	Envy, uncontrolled drinking and feasting, and such things: of which I give you word clearly, even as I did in the past, that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God.
43012036	Faith	In so far as you have the light, put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light. With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them.
58003002	Faith	Who kept faith with God who gave him his place, even as Moses did in all his house.
56003006	Grace	Which he gave us freely through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
44004036	Description	And Joseph, who was given by the Apostles the name of Barnabas (the sense of which is, Son of comfort), a Levite and a man of Cyprus by birth,
48006009	Recommendation	And let us not get tired of well-doing; for at the right time we will get in the grain, if we do not give way to weariness.
48002019	Faith	For I, through the law, have become dead to the law, so that I might be living to God.
66011001	Recommendation	And there was given to me a measuring rod: and one said, Go up and take the measure of the house of God, and the altar, and the worshippers in it.
66014004	Description	These are they who have not made themselves unclean with women; for they are virgins. These are they who go after the Lamb wherever he goes. These were taken from among men to be the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.
66009007	Description	And the forms of the locusts were like horses made ready for war; and on their heads they had crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.
60002016	Recommendation	As those who are free, not using your free position as a cover for wrongdoing, but living as the servants of God;
54004010	Faith	And this is the purpose of all our work and our fighting, because our hope is in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, and specially of those who have faith.
58010029	Sin	But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot, and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing, and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace, be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment?
43020021	Grace	And Jesus said to them again, May peace be with you! As the Father sent me, even so I now send you.
65001016	Sin	These are the men who make trouble, ever desiring change, going after evil pleasures, using high-sounding words, respecting men's position in the hope of reward.
66006015	Description	And the kings of the earth, and the rulers, and the chief captains, and the men of wealth, and the strong, and every servant and free man, took cover in the holes and the rocks of the mountains;
66021008	Sin	But those who are full of fear and without faith, the unclean and takers of life, those who do the sins of the flesh, and those who make use of evil powers or who give worship to images, and all those who are false, will have their part in the sea of ever-burning fire which is the second death.
44022016	Recommendation	And now, why are you waiting? get up, and have baptism, for the washing away of your sins, giving worship to his name.
66009008	Description	And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.
55002024	Recommendation	For it is not right for the Lord's servant to make trouble, but he is to be gentle to all, ready in teaching, putting up with wrong,
51002005	Faith	For though I am not present in the flesh, still I am with you in the spirit, seeing with joy your order, and your unchanging faith in Christ.
60003012	Sin	For the eyes of the Lord are on the upright, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
53002013	Faith	But it is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you, brothers, loved by the Lord, because it was the purpose of God from the first that you might have salvation, being made holy by the Spirit and by faith in what is true:
66022011	Recommendation	Let the evil man go on in his evil: and let the unclean be still unclean: and let the upright go on in his righteousness: and let the holy be holy still.
44002038	Faith	And Peter said, Let your hearts be changed, every one of you, and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you.
52005015	Recommendation	Let no one give evil for evil; but ever go after what is good, for one another and for all.
45001027	Sin	And in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another, men doing shame with men, and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evil-doing.
50002018	Recommendation	And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy.
44003019	Recommendation	So then, let your hearts be changed and be turned to God, so that your sins may be completely taken away, and times of blessing may come from the Lord;
66021025	Description	And the doors of it will never be shut by day (for there is no night there):
43006054	Faith	He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life: and I will take him up from the dead at the last day.
43019011	Sin	Jesus gave this answer: You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God; so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin.
59002017	Faith	Even so faith without works is dead.
45008003	Sin	For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh, God, sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh, and as an offering for sin, gave his decision against sin in the flesh:
60003014	Recommendation	But you are happy if you undergo pain because of righteousness; have no part in their fear and do not be troubled;
51003021	Recommendation	Fathers, do not be hard on your children, so that their spirit may not be broken.
66018002	Sin	And he gave a loud cry, saying, Babylon the great has come down from her high place, she has come to destruction and has become a place of evil spirits, and of every unclean spirit, and a hole for every unclean and hated bird.
62002022	Sin	Who is false but he who says that Jesus is not the Christ? He is the Antichrist who has no belief in the Father or the Son.
46011027	Sin	If, then, anyone takes the bread or the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit, he will be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord.
59002020	Faith	Do you not see, O foolish man, that faith without works is of no use?
43018003	Description	So Judas, getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lights and with arms.
53003003	Grace	But the Lord is true, who will give you strength and keep you safe from evil.
44007021	Description	And when he was put out, Pharaoh's daughter took him and kept him as her son.
66008005	Description	And the angel took the vessel; and he made it full of the fire of the altar, and sent it down on the earth: and there came thunders and voices and flames and a shaking of the earth.
66018003	Sin	For through the wine of the wrath of her evil desires all the nations have come to destruction; and the kings of the earth made themselves unclean with her, and the traders of the earth had their wealth increased by the power of her evil ways.
44026021	Violence	For this reason, the Jews took me in the Temple, and made an attempt to put me to death.
55004004	Sin	And shutting their ears to what is true, will be turned away to belief in foolish stories.
43006064	Faith	But still some of you have no faith. For it was clear to Jesus from the first who they were who had no faith, and who it was who would be false to him.
43013026	Description	This was the answer Jesus gave: It is the one to whom I will give this bit of bread after I have put it in the vessel. Then he took the bit of bread, put it into the vessel, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
54006020	Recommendation	O Timothy, take good care of that which is given to you, turning away from the wrong and foolish talk and arguments of that knowledge which is falsely so named;
44017005	Violence	But the Jews, being moved with envy, took with them certain low persons from among the common people, and getting together a great number of people, made an outcry in the town, attacking the house of Jason with the purpose of taking them out to the people.
62005016	Sin	If a man sees his brother doing a sin which is not bad enough for death, let him make a prayer to God, and God will give life to him whose sin was not bad enough for death. There is a sin whose punishment is death: I do not say that he may make such a request then.
43013020	Faith	Truly I say to you, He who takes to his heart anyone whom I send, takes me to his heart; and he who so takes me, takes him who sent me.
58012028	Faith	If then, we have a kingdom which will never be moved, let us have grace, so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect:
44019013	Description	But some of the Jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits, took it on themselves to make use of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, I give you orders, by Jesus, whom Paul is preaching.
44015040	Grace	But Paul took Silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers.
63001008	Recommendation	Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward.
66011006	Violence	These have the power to keep the heaven shut, so that there may be no rain in the days when they are prophets: and they have power over the waters to make them into blood, and to send every sort of disease on the earth as their pleasure is.
44008021	Sin	You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God.
43017010	Faith	(All mine are yours, and yours are mine) and I have glory in them.
45003012	Sin	They have all gone out of the way, there is no profit in any of them; there is not one who does good, not so much as one:
50002003	Recommendation	Doing nothing through envy or through pride, but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself;
66001013	Description	And in the middle of them one like a son of man, clothed with a robe down to his feet, and with a band of gold round his breasts.
66022003	Faith	And there will be no more curse: and the high seat of God and of the Lamb will be there; and his servants will be worshipping him;
60004007	Recommendation	But the end of all things is near: so be serious in your behaviour and keep on the watch with prayer;
44014026	Grace	And from there they went by ship to Antioch, where they had been handed over to the grace of God for the work which they had not done.
46007028	Recommendation	If you get married it is not a sin; and if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin. But those who do so will have trouble in the flesh. But I will not be hard on you.
49006012	Sin	For our fight is not against flesh and blood, but against authorities and powers, against the world-rulers of this dark night, against the spirits of evil in the heavens.
59001005	Recommendation	But if any man among you is without wisdom, let him make his request to God, who gives freely to all without an unkind word, and it will be given to him.
52005019	Recommendation	Do not put out the light of the Spirit;
58009002	Description	For the first Tent was made ready, having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread; and this is named the holy place.
66003018	Recommendation	If you are wise you will get from me gold tested by fire, so that you may have true wealth; and white robes to put on, so that your shame may not be seen; and oil for your eyes, so that you may see.
62005013	Faith	I have put these things in writing for you who have faith in the name of the Son of God, so that you may be certain that you have eternal life.
43007018	Faith	The man whose words come from himself is looking for glory for himself, but he who is looking for the glory of him who sent him — that man is true and there is no evil in him.
47004007	Grace	But we have this wealth in vessels of earth, so that it may be seen that the power comes not from us but from God;
45012019	Recommendation	Do not give punishment for wrongs done to you, dear brothers, but give way to the wrath of God; for it is said in the holy Writings, Punishment is mine, I will give reward, says the Lord.
43008054	Faith	Jesus said in answer, If I take glory for myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who gives me glory, of whom you say that he is your God.
45014020	Recommendation	Do not let the work of God come to nothing on account of food. All things are certainly clean; but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another.
43019040	Description	Then they took the body of Jesus, folding linen about it with the spices, as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest.
58010034	Faith	For you had pity on those who were in prison, and had joy in the loss of your property, in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever.
44013023	Grace	From this man's seed has God given to Israel a Saviour, even Jesus, as he gave his word;
46002009	Faith	But as it says in the holy Writings, Things which the eye saw not, and which had not come to the ears or into the heart of man, such things as God has made ready for those who have love for him.
45008011	Grace	But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you, he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way, through his Spirit which is in you, give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death.
45008016	Faith	The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God:
48006007	Recommendation	Be not tricked; God is not made sport of: for whatever seed a man puts in, that will he get back as grain.
45011022	Grace	See then that God is good but his rules are fixed: to those who were put away he was hard, but to you he has been good, on the condition that you keep in his mercy; if not, you will be cut off as they were.
59005007	Recommendation	Go on waiting calmly, my brothers, till the coming of the Lord, like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come.
55001016	Grace	May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus because he frequently gave me help, and had no feeling of shame because I was in chains;
62002028	Faith	And now, my children, keep your hearts in him; so that at his revelation, we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming.
48005016	Recommendation	But I say, Go on in the Spirit, and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh.
54001015	Grace	It is a true saying, in which all may put their faith, that Christ Jesus came into the world to give salvation to sinners, of whom I am the chief:
49006010	Faith	Lastly, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his power.
46010012	Recommendation	So let him who seems to himself to be safe go in fear of a fall.
58010014	Grace	Because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy.
43010031	Violence	Then the Jews took up stones again to send at him.
46011003	Description	But it is important for you to keep this fact in mind, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.
58011036	Violence	And others were tested by being laughed at or by blows, and even with chains and prisons:
58006019	Faith	And this hope is like a strong band for our souls, fixed and certain, and going in to that which is inside the veil;
49005011	Recommendation	And have no company with the works of the dark, which give no fruit, but make their true quality clear;
59004011	Recommendation	Do not say evil against one another, my brothers. He who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brother's judge, says evil against the law and is judging the law: and in judging the law you become, not a doer of the law but a judge.
66021021	Description	And the twelve doors were twelve pearls; every door was made of one pearl; and the street of the town was clear gold, as clear as glass.
58003006	Faith	But Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end.
45012009	Recommendation	Let love be without deceit. Be haters of what is evil; keep your minds fixed on what is good.
66011013	Violence	And in that hour there was a great earth-shock and a tenth part of the town came to destruction; and in the earth-shock seven thousand persons came to their end: and the rest were in fear, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
48003020	Description	Now a go-between is not a go-between of one; but God is one.
43019010	Description	Then Pilate said to him, You say nothing to me? is it not clear to you that I have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross?
44008032	Description	Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound:
44013021	Description	Then at their request for a king, God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the family of Benjamin, who was their king for forty years.
56001010	Sin	For there are men who are not ruled by law; foolish talkers, false teachers, specially those of the circumcision,
44010012	Description	In which were all sorts of beasts and birds.
43017022	Grace	And the glory which you have given to me I have given to them, so that they may be one even as we are one;
55001013	Faith	Keep the form of those true words which you had from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
43002006	Description	Now six pots of stone, every one taking two or three firkins of water, were placed there for the purpose of washing, as is the way of the Jews.
46015034	Recommendation	Be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I say this to put you to shame.
49004002	Recommendation	With all gentle and quiet behaviour, taking whatever comes, putting up with one another in love;
65001023	Recommendation	And to some give salvation, pulling them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the clothing which is made unclean by the flesh.
45008028	Grace	And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been marked out by his purpose.
45016019	Recommendation	For all have knowledge of how you do what you are ordered. For this reason I have joy in you, but it is my desire that you may be wise in what is good, and without knowledge of evil.
