51004005	Recommendation	Walk in wisdom toward those outside, and redeem the time.
45006006	Faith	We know this, that our old man was crucified with him, in order that the body of sin might be destroyed. This happened so that we should no longer be enslaved to sin.
62003010	Sin	In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed: Whoever does not do what is righteous is not from God, neither is the one who does not love his brother.
45008007	Sin	The mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God, for it is not subject to God's law, nor is it able to do so.
44002026	Faith	Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced. Also, my flesh will live in certain hope.
46010020	Sin	But I say about the things the Gentile pagans sacrifice, that they offer these things to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons!
44013001	Description	Now in the church in Antioch, there were some prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon (who is called Niger), Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.

56001011	Sin	It is necessary to stop them. They are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful profit what they should not teach.

44026017	Grace	and I will rescue you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you,
56003003	Sin	For once we ourselves were thoughtless and disobedient. We were led astray and enslaved by various passions and pleasures. We lived in evil and envy. We were detestable and hated one another.
54005021	Recommendation	I solemnly command you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to keep these commands without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism.
58010035	Recommendation	So do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.

51003012	Recommendation	Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, put on a heart of mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
43012026	Faith	If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.

59002011	Sin	For the one who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery, but if you do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.

45003013	Sin	“Their throat is an open grave. Their tongues have deceived. The poison of snakes is under their lips.”

54003009	Faith	They should keep the revealed truth of the faith with a clean conscience.
54006002	Recommendation	The slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect them because they are brothers. Instead, they should serve them all the more. For the masters who are helped by their work are believers and are loved. Teach and declare these things.

43015012	Recommendation	This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.
45006013	Recommendation	Do not present the parts of your body to sin, to be tools used for unrighteousness. But present yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life, and present the parts of your body to God as tools to be used for righteousness.
58010039	Faith	But we are not any of those who turn back to destruction. Instead, we are some of those who have faith for keeping our soul.

52002015	Violence	It was the Jews who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets. It was the Jews who drove us out. They do not please God. Instead, they are hostile to all people.

49002006	Grace	God raised us up together with Christ, and God made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

49002001	Grace	And as for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.
46010021	Sin	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot have fellowship at the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
49005003	Recommendation	But there must not be even a suggestion among you of sexual immorality or any kind of impurity or of greed, for these are improper for God's holy people.

50001021	Faith	For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
50001006	Faith	I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.
62005020	Faith	But we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. Also, we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This one is the true God and eternal life.

47005006	Faith	Therefore always be confident. Be aware that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.
43012047	Grace	If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

53003010	Recommendation	When we were with you, we commanded you, “The one who is unwilling to work must not eat.”
43003016	Grace	For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

44027002	Description	We boarded a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail along the coast of Asia. So we went to sea. Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia went with us.
58013003	Recommendation	Remember prisoners, as if you were bound with them. Remember those who are mistreated, as if you also were them in the body.

45016017	Recommendation	Now I urge you, brothers, to think about those who are causing the divisions and stumbling. They are going beyond the teaching that you have learned. Turn away from them.
45012007	Recommendation	If one's gift is service, let him serve. If one has the gift of teaching, let him teach.
43016023	Faith	On that day you will not ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.
66021019	Description	The foundations of the wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first was jasper, the second was sapphire, the third was agate, the fourth was emerald,

66019005	Faith	Then a voice came out from the throne, saying, “Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both the unimportant and the powerful.”

48006004	Recommendation	Each one should examine his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in someone else.
46007036	Recommendation	But if anyone thinks that he is not treating his fiancée with respect—if she is beyond the age of marriage and it must be so—he should do what he wants. He is not sinning. They should marry.

66016006	Sin	Because they poured out the blood of the saints and prophets, you have given them blood to drink; it is what they deserve.”
45006002	Sin	May it never be. We who died to sin, how can we still live in it?
66017011	Violence	The beast that existed, but does not exist now, is itself also an eighth king; but it is one of those seven kings, and it is going to destruction.
48004030	Recommendation	But what does the scripture say? “Send away the slave girl and her son. For the son of the slave girl will not share in the inheritance with the son of the free woman.”
54006009	Sin	Now those who want to become wealthy fall into temptation, into a trap. They fall into many foolish and harmful passions, and into whatever else makes people sink into ruin and destruction.
66017016	Violence	The ten horns that you saw—they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, they will devour her flesh, and they will burn her completely with fire.
46008003	Faith	But if anyone loves God, that person is known by him.
45003009	Sin	What then? Are we excusing ourselves? Not at all. For we have already accused both Jews and Greeks, all of them, of being under sin.
44007041	Sin	So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced because of the work of their hands.
66009020	Sin	The rest of mankind, those who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the deeds they had done, nor did they stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—things that cannot see, hear, or walk.
47005011	Faith	Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people. What we are is clearly seen by God. I expect that it is also clear to your conscience.
49002003	Sin	Once we all lived among these people, fulfilling the evil desires of our sinful nature, and carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind. We were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of humanity.

45008013	Faith	For if you live according to the flesh, you are about to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions, you will live.
45010011	Faith	For scripture says, “Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame.”
45001008	Faith	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.

46004016	Recommendation	So I urge you to be imitators of me.
46001021	Faith	Since the world in its wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.
60003001	Recommendation	In this way, you who are wives should submit to your own husbands. Do this so even if some men are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word, through their wives' behavior.

46010010	Recommendation	Also do not grumble, as many of them did and were destroyed by an angel of death.
47002017	Faith	For we are not like so many people who sell the word of God for profit. Instead, with purity of motives, we speak in Christ, as we are sent from God, in the sight of God.
45015001	Recommendation	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and ought not to please ourselves.
50002024	Faith	But I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.

53001003	Faith	We should always give thanks to God for you, brothers. For this is appropriate, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love each of you has for one another increases.

55001009	Grace	It is God who saved us and called us with a holy calling. He did this, not according to our works, but according to his own plan and grace. He gave us these things in Christ Jesus before times ever began.

58011007	Faith	It was by faith that Noah, having been given a divine message about things not yet seen, with godly reverence built a ship to save his household. By doing this, he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that is according to faith.
58009006	Description	After these things were prepared, the priests always entered the outer room of the tabernacle to perform their services.
44007051	Sin	You people who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; you act just as your fathers acted.
54001009	Sin	We know this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for a lawless and rebellious people, for ungodly people and sinners, and for those who are godless and profane. It is made for those who kill their fathers and mothers, for murderers,

59005001	Recommendation	Come now, you who are rich, weep and wail because of the miseries coming on you.
66002010	Recommendation	Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Look! The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you will be tested, and you will suffer for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.

54002012	Recommendation	I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to live in quietness.
46001009	Faith	God is faithful, who called you into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

59002012	Recommendation	So speak and act as those who will be judged by means of the law of freedom.
46012005	Faith	There are different ministries, but the same Lord;

66014011	Description	The smoke from their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night—these worshipers of the beast and his image, and everyone who receives the mark of his name.
47004001	Faith	Therefore, because we have this ministry, and just as we have received mercy, we do not become discouraged.

47001004	Grace	God comforts us in all our affliction, so that we can comfort those who are in any affliction. We comfort others with the same comfort that God used to comfort us.
