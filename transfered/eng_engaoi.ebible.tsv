59004010	Recommendation	And when you pray to God, don't be proud but bow down to him and he will lift you up.
54005014	Recommendation	I think that those widows should marry again and have children and look after their husbands and their children. Then people who hate us won't say anything bad about us who belong to God.
59005010	Recommendation	Listen, brothers and sisters. Long ago the prophets used to tell God's word to his people. When they suffered and were upset they didn't grumble.
49005005	Sin	Don't forget this. If you do wrong and take other people's wives or husbands or run off with other women and if you are greedy, always wanting what belongs to someone else, you can't go to God. Wanting other people's things is like obeying idols instead of obeying God. If you do wrong things like that you can't have fellowship with people who God and Christ rule over.
49005018	Recommendation	Don't get drunk with beer, because it will spoil you. Don't fill yourselves with it, but be filled with God's Spirit.
49002018	Faith	God's Spirit helps us all today to go to our Father, because Christ died for us all.
49004014	Recommendation	Listen. Some people might tell us lies, first one thing and then another. They might make up different things and then want to teach them to us, but we mustn't listen to things like that. We should be strong and keep on going on God's straight road.
54006018	Recommendation	Tell them to be good to others and to keep busy doing all kinds of good things. Tell them to be generous and to share their things with other people.
59002026	Faith	Look! If you say, “I believe in God,” but you speak carelessly, just speaking words with your lips and nothing more than that, then you are just like a dead person. A dead person can't move, he can't do anything good, he can't obey God. And if you don't obey God, you will be the same as a dead person.
49006018	Faith	You should also pray to God. His Spirit will teach you the words to say to him. So don't stop praying but keep on asking him every day to help you and all of us who belong to him.
59005015	Faith	Those people trust in the Lord Jesus, so when they ask him to heal one of you who is sick, the Lord Jesus will heal you, and he will forgive the wrong things that you have done.
54004016	Recommendation	Watch yourself and keep on telling people God's word and don't stop doing that. When you keep telling them his word, God will save you and also those who listen to you.
54004007	Recommendation	Some people tell each other silly stories. Don't listen to them and don't tell other people those stories, because they are no good. But keep following God all the time.
59003017	Description	But God taught you to be wise like him. If you follow God's way, then you will go straight, you will go peacefully and you will be gentle and willing to listen. You will have pity on other people and look after them. You will know about doing only what is right and nothing wrong, and so you will keep on doing what is right. You won't tell lies or think bad things about other people. When you do anything wrong, you won't say, “Look, I have done right.” You will be honest.
59002024	Faith	If any of you believe in God and obey him, God will say, “You are right with me.” But if you don't obey God, even if you really believe in him, God won't say that about you.
49004026	Recommendation	When you get angry, don't do wrong. And don't stay angry all day.
49006014	Recommendation	So stand up and be like God's soldier. Speak true words that God gives you. That is like tying a strong belt around your waist. Go straight all the time without doing wrong. That is like wearing iron on your chest.
54001001	Description	I, Paul, am writing to you, Timothy. God and Jesus Christ chose me as an apostle of Jesus Christ. They told me to spread Jesus' teaching everywhere. God has saved us, and Jesus Christ is the one who will take us to heaven.
54002009	Recommendation	And I don't want the women to wear the wrong kind of clothes that will make us feel ashamed. They should wear the right kind of clothes. And they shouldn't make themselves beautiful with gold bangles and lovely necklaces and expensive clothes and doing different things to their hair.
49002010	Grace	God has saved us all. He decided to make us and he said, “I will make my people so that they will do good, because they will have fellowship with Jesus Christ.”
49006017	Recommendation	Believe that Jesus Christ has saved you. That is like wearing those hard helmets that soldiers wear on their heads. And take God's word. That is like taking a sword. And God's Spirit will help you to drive Satan away with God's word, just like soldiers who drive people away with their swords.
54002011	Recommendation	When the men teach the women, the women should not be proud but they should listen to them quietly.
54005019	Recommendation	Sometimes people blame the church elders for doing something wrong. If one person speaks to you about it, don't take any notice. Only listen if two or three people see him doing wrong and come and tell you.
59005016	Recommendation	Don't hide your sins, but tell one of God's people about them. Then he will pray to God for you. And you should pray to God for him too, so that God can heal you both. When good people pray to God their words are powerful.
49006005	Recommendation	For some of you people, bosses have paid money to others for you so that you could work for those bosses. You must never trick your bosses, you should be honest and straight with them. Even if you are afraid of them you must obey them every day. Work for them as though you are working for Jesus Christ.
54005016	Recommendation	If a Christian woman has widows in her family, she should look after them herself. She must not let other Christians look after them. She must look after them herself, so that the other Christians can look after the widows who live alone.
49003013	Faith	My friends, don't be discouraged about me being in jail. It doesn't matter that I am here because I have told you about Jesus Christ. Good things will happen to you later because I am here today.
49005006	Recommendation	So don't take any notice of people who want to trick you with silly words. They want you to do wrong, but God will be angry with you if you don't obey him and you keep on doing wrong all the time.
54005021	Recommendation	I am telling you this in front of God and Jesus Christ and the angels. You must obey everything I have told you. Don't speak good words to some people and bad words to others. Speak the same way to everyone.
54003004	Description	He must look after his own family well and control his children so that they obey him.
59002025	Description	Listen to another story about long ago, when a woman who didn't belong to Israel lived in Jericho. She was called Rahab. She was a bad woman because she slept with many men. Even though she didn't belong to Israel, she helped two men who were from Israel. They visited Jericho to see if it was a strong city. Rahab hid the men and they got away by a different road and went back to Israel safely. Because she helped them, God was pleased with her.
54002015	Faith	If a woman doesn't shame other people but loves them and trusts God and has a clean mind, then God will save her when she has children.
59002011	Sin	God said, “Don't take another man's wife.” And the same God said, “Don't murder anyone.” So, if you don't take another man's wife, but you murder someone, you are breaking all God's laws.
59002023	Faith	Listen to this word from God's book. “Abraham believed God, and so God said, ‘This man is right with me.’ ” That word became true, and God and Abraham became friends.
59002001	Faith	Brothers and sisters, listen to this. You believe in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ our Lord is the greatest one of all. He loves all of us different people in the same way, not only some of us but all of us. So you should love all different people in the same way yourselves.
49005028	Recommendation	Christ really loves us very much. And you men should love your wives. You love your bodies and look after them all the time. So you should love your wives all the time. When you love them, you are really loving yourselves.
54003009	Faith	They must keep holding on to the truth that God has made clear to us and always do what they know is right.
54006002	Recommendation	But some bosses are Christians. So tell their servants this message from me, and say, “Don't think, ‘My boss is no good,’ because they are like your own brothers. Those bosses that you work for are also Christians. So you should love them and because of that you should do even better work for them.” So you must tell your people those things.
49002006	Grace	God made Jesus Christ come alive and he took him up to heaven and made him sit down to rule there. And God has taken us to heaven too, and we too are ruling with Jesus Christ because we have fellowship with Jesus Christ.
49004025	Recommendation	So you must not tell lies any more. When God's people are talking together, you must tell the truth, because we are all in one group with Christ like friends.
59001002	Recommendation	My dear brothers and sisters, all kinds of troubles will come to you, but don't worry. You should be very happy,
54001018	Recommendation	You are like my son, and you must do what I tell you, because I am following the words God gave some people when they spoke before about you. When you fight against Satan, think carefully about the words they spoke.
49002001	Grace	Before you knew God, you were separated from him. You were like dead people, because you had disobeyed God and done wrong.
49005003	Recommendation	So don't think about wrong things. Don't take other people's wives or husbands, don't think about running off with women and don't be greedy, always wanting what belongs to someone else. Don't even talk about those things, because you belong to God.
54001017	Faith	Let us praise God our King who rules forever. He cannot die, he will live forever. We can't see him, but he is the only God. So let us honour him forever because he is so great. Amen.
54002007	Faith	And because of that God chose me to be an apostle and to tell people about Jesus Christ. That is true. I am not lying, I am speaking the truth. God sent me to the people who are not Jews to tell them the truth, so that they can hear and trust in Jesus Christ.
49004031	Recommendation	Get rid of swearing and angry words. Don't keep on shouting. Don't tease other people. And don't keep telling bad things about other people. And don't be always hating each other,
54003006	Sin	But a church leader mustn't be someone who has only known God for a short time, he should be someone who has known God for a long time. If he has only known God for a short time, he might be proud and he might think, “I am an important person.” If he thinks that, then God will say, “That person is very bad.” Long ago Satan too thought he was important. But God said, “Satan is bad.” That kind of person shouldn't be a leader over God's people.
59004017	Sin	If any of you know about doing good but you don't do it, you are very bad.
54006009	Sin	Those people who want to get rich are following the wrong road. It is the bad things in their minds that tempt them to do wrong. And in the end they will lose everything and bad things will happen to them.
49002003	Sin	But all of us disobeyed God. We did what we wanted to do, whatever came into our minds. And we did what our bodies wanted, and anything other people were doing, we did that too. Because of that God should have been angry with all of us,
59001027	Faith	But if any of you are obeying God properly and worshipping him, you will help other people all the time. You are the ones our Father God will see as perfect. When children are sad because their fathers and mothers have died, you will help them. When a widow is sad after her husband has died, you will help her too. You will keep working busily all the time. And if bad people tempt you to do wrong you will take no notice but keep on being good.
59004009	Recommendation	Look! Don't be happy and laugh, but cry and wail in sadness.
54006006	Faith	It is true that if you follow God's road you should be happy. You should be happy just as though you are rich. But you mustn't keep wanting other things. You must say, “I have enough.” Only then will you be really happy.
49005004	Recommendation	And never use bad language. You should only speak good words and give thanks to God.
59002014	Faith	Brothers and sisters, if one of you says, “I trust in God all the time,” but you don't obey God, you think God will save you just because of what you said, don't you! No, he won't! God won't save you just because you speak like that.
54003007	Recommendation	When people who don't know God see a man leading God's people, they should say, “That man is very good.” But if they say, “He is bad,” then he shouldn't be a leader over God's people because Satan will control him and those people who don't know God will shame him.
49004007	Grace	God's word tells us that Christ has gone back to his Father in heaven. It says, “He went first to heaven, and took many people with him. And they followed him afterwards. Then he gave good things to his people.” You know that first Christ came down from above, and he was born like us and lived like us in the world. Then afterwards the same one who came down went up again, so that he could be everywhere and give us good things. Christ has freely given good things to each one of us.
49006006	Recommendation	Don't do careless work, but work well for them. You should work well for them when they can see you and when they can't see you. Do everything properly, everything that God wants you to do.
54001006	Sin	But some people aren't doing those kinds of things any more. They keep on arguing with silly words. They are like people who are lost and who have forgotten where they are.
49005033	Recommendation	You men must each love your wife in the same way as you love yourself. And you wives must obey your husbands.
54004014	Recommendation	You know that some men told you before about God's word to you. At the same time the church elders laid their hands on you and God's Spirit made you strong. Don't forget that,
49004022	Recommendation	So don't go on doing what you used to do, because those bad things you wanted were spoiling you. Get rid of sin, just like you get rid of old clothes that are no use now.
49005015	Recommendation	So you should think carefully about what you should do and how you should live. Don't be like people who don't know about doing good, but be sensible like wise people.
49004028	Recommendation	You thieves who have been stealing things must stop stealing and work now. You must do good work to get honest money so you can share with poor people.
59005013	Recommendation	Has something bad happened to one of you and you are upset about it? If you are upset, tell God about it. Don't grumble but pray to God. Are you happy today? If you are rejoicing, praise God with songs.
49004017	Recommendation	I am speaking to you for the Lord Jesus Christ, and so I am warning you. Don't go on living like people who don't know God. Their thoughts are no good. So don't be like them.
49005021	Recommendation	Don't think of yourselves but obey other people because you respect Christ.
54005020	Recommendation	But if an elder keeps on doing something wrong, blame him in front of the other elders so that when the other elders hear what you say they will be afraid and not do anything wrong themselves.
49004030	Faith	God has chosen you to be his own people. And he has freely given you his Holy Spirit, so that you will know that you are truly his, and that he will set you free. So don't make God's Spirit sad.
59004001	Sin	Why are you always fighting each other? And why are you always arguing with each other? You are doing those things because you keep wanting all kinds of things. You become upset and you don't have any peace.
54004001	Sin	God's Spirit tells us that some people will later reject God after trusting in him at first. They will believe in evil spirits that tell lies and they will follow their teaching.
59004004	Sin	You bad people, you have run away from God. You go around with people who are always doing wrong as if you hate God and get angry with him.
54005001	Recommendation	If an old man does something wrong, don't speak angrily to him but speak quietly. You should speak to him in the same way that you speak to your father. And speak to young men as though you are speaking to your brothers.
59004008	Recommendation	And come close to God. When you come close to him, he will come close to you. You bad people, don't sin any more. You want to follow God's way and you want to follow Satan's way too, but you can't go both ways. So make sure you follow God's way today with one mind.
59002009	Sin	But if you only love some people and not everyone, you will be breaking God's laws and doing wrong.
49006011	Recommendation	God has given us strong things for fighting Satan and you must take them and wear them so that when Satan tries to trick you and tempt you to do wrong, you can keep standing strong.
59003009	Faith	You and I praise our Lord and Father with our tongues. But we speak bad words with them too, and we curse other people. God made those people, he made them like himself.
59001019	Recommendation	My dear brothers and sisters, don't forget this. You mustn't be always telling people God's word, you should listen to his word. And you mustn't get angry quickly.
49006016	Faith	Trust God all the time. That is like carrying a wooden shield all the time so that Satan's burning spears won't hit you.
59001026	Sin	One of you might say, “I obey God and I worship him.” But if you speak bad words, speaking carelessly all the time, you will not really be obeying and worshipping God. You will just be tricking yourself.
54005008	Faith	It is really bad if a person doesn't take care of his family. It is as though he is rejecting God. It is wrong when people who don't know God do that kind of thing, but it is worse if God's people do it.
54005005	Faith	Is there a widow who has no one to look after her and she is living alone? She has put her hope in God. She always prays to him, asking him day and night to help her.
59004003	Sin	And when you ask God, you do not get what you want, because you don't want what God wants but you want everything for yourself.
49005020	Faith	You should thank God our Father all the time. When you worship him you should use the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
54005022	Recommendation	Don't choose church leaders and lay hands on them quickly. And this is another thing. If other people do wrong, don't go with them but keep doing the right thing all the time.
59001022	Recommendation	When you listen to God's word, you must do everything he has told you to do. If you listen to it and then you quickly forget it and don't do what God wants, you are tricking yourselves. You should listen to God's word and obey it.
59005004	Sin	Look! You haven't paid the men who work for you. They have gathered your food crops and taken them to you, and you haven't given them any money. It is as though that money is speaking bad words about you to God. He is the most powerful Lord and he has heard them.
49005022	Recommendation	Wives, let your husbands lead, but you follow them. That is right. Christ leads and God's people follow him, so it is all right for the husband to lead. Christ saves us. He leads and controls us, and that is good. So it is right when a man leads and controls his wife.
54004013	Recommendation	I will come to you later. So keep busy until I come. Read God's word and teach it to the people there and show them the right way to live.
49004024	Recommendation	Start that good new way like new people, because God has made you new like himself. So walk straight on God's road all the time.
49003002	Grace	Maybe you have heard that God has been kind to me. He has chosen me to tell you about him, because it is good that you should know.
59005014	Recommendation	Are you sick today? If you are sick, send for the church elders, and they will pray for you. And they will put olive oil on your head, and use Jesus' name.
59002007	Sin	They are the people who make fun of Jesus Christ. They speak bad words and they use his name in a bad way. But his name is the one people used when they baptized you.
54003003	Description	He must not get drunk or be a troublemaker. He must be gentle with people and peaceful. And he must not love money.
59002008	Recommendation	God's law tells us, “You should love your neighbour as you love yourself.” If you obey that law, you will be doing the right thing.
49005025	Recommendation	Husbands, love your wives in the same way that Christ loved God's people. Christ loved us and he died for us,
54003011	Recommendation	The wives of the helpers must also be good women. When people see them they will say, “Those women are very good.” They must not talk about people to spread things around and make trouble but they must only think about what is good. They must be good and honest all the time.
54003016	Grace	God's word is very good. Truly that word is important that was hidden before, the one that tells us about Jesus Christ: He came into the world, he became a person like us. God's Spirit has shown us that Jesus has done what God wanted him to do. God's angels have seen him. Some of God's people have told others about him all over the world. And some of the people in the world believe now that Jesus is God's Son. But God has taken Jesus back again to heaven.
54006001	Recommendation	For some of God's people, bosses have paid money to others for them so that they can work for those bosses. But you must tell those servants from me not to be angry with their bosses but to work well for them. If the servants don't work well, other people will see that, and they will speak badly about God's name and about our teaching.
54006003	Faith	If anyone teaches something different to other people, then he is not holding on to the truth that Jesus Christ our Lord taught them, the teaching about doing God's will.
54001009	Sin	We know that those laws were only made for people who do wrong and not for good people. They were made for those who don't obey God and don't obey other people either. Those people turn their backs on God. They hate him and they live as they like. They keep on doing wrong. Some murder people, even killing their fathers and mothers.
59005001	Recommendation	Listen to me, you people who are so rich. You had better start to cry now, because big trouble is coming to you soon.
54006011	Recommendation	But you are a man of God. So don't do any of those wrong things I have told you about but keep on doing what is good. And don't stop following God. You must keep going straight with faith and love and be gentle with people.
59005005	Sin	You have done whatever you liked here in this world. You have thought about yourselves all the time. You have done just as you wanted day and night, eating and growing fat. Listen! When bullocks grow fat, what do people do? They kill them, so now you are like that fat bullock!
54002012	Recommendation	I do not want the women to teach the men or lead them. They must listen quietly to the men.
59002012	Recommendation	God has given us his laws that set us free. So you should speak and do what those laws say.
49006004	Recommendation	Fathers, don't be angry with your children but be kind to them, so that they won't get angry when you speak to them. Bring them up properly. Keep teaching them carefully to obey Jesus Christ so that God's word will keep them going straight.
59001021	Recommendation	So get rid of all the bad things you are doing once and for all. Don't think about them any more. Don't be proud, but take in God's word that he puts in your mind and heart. That word will save you.
49004015	Faith	We must speak the truth. We mustn't speak angrily to people but quietly, so that they know that we love them. We must try to be like Christ, the one who rules over us. He is like the head and we are like his body,
49004003	Faith	God has brought us together by his Spirit to make us friends. So you should really want to stay together, to love and help each other in peace.
54005017	Recommendation	The church elders who work for God help people to follow him. So you must pay them. If they do good work and teach people God's word and show them how to behave, you should pay them more.
49006009	Recommendation	You bosses who have bought people to work for you, you must be honest and straight with them too. Don't say to them, “I will beat you if you don't work well!” You bosses and your servants are all the same to God. He is the Lord of you all, bosses and workers too. He doesn't say, “Maybe this man is a boss, maybe he is a servant.” He says, “Maybe this man is good, maybe he is not.”
54004010	Faith	We work for God without stopping and we will go on working for him, because we hope in him. He is the living God, and he saves those of us who trust in him and he wants to save all people.
59002017	Faith	When any of you believe in God but don't obey him, that is very wrong. You should believe in God and also obey him. That is good.
59002020	Faith	If you say, “I believe in God,” but you don't obey him and you don't love other people, you are tricking yourself. You aren't talking sense.
54006020	Recommendation	You must keep safe all the true things God's people believe. You must look after them so that other people won't change them. Some people say, “Only the things that we know are true.” Don't listen to those people arguing or to the silly, wrong things they say. They are going the wrong way and have lost the true things that God's people believe. I pray that God will be kind to you and to all the people who live there with you.
49006012	Sin	We really are in a fight with Satan now. We aren't fighting with other people, but with Satan and with his evil spirits. They rule over this dark world and they are the evil ones in the heavenly world. Satan has many different evil spirits and they are all very bad.
59001005	Recommendation	Maybe you will say to yourself, “What shall I do? What is the right thing for me to do?” Then you should say to God, “Father, what is right, and what is wrong? I don't know, so please help me to know,” because you don't know by yourself. God won't refuse, he will listen when you pray to him. He will listen to you and he will help you. He won't blame you for not knowing what to do.
59005007	Recommendation	Brothers and sisters, keep going carefully along God's road until Jesus comes back again. Think about yams. When it rains they get fat for you to eat. You wait patiently until they get fat and when the time comes you dig them.
54001015	Grace	Jesus Christ came down from heaven into the world to save us sinners. That is very true and we should believe it. And I am the very worst sinner.
49006010	Faith	Dear friends, I haven't got a lot more to say, just a few words. Stay close to the Lord. He is very powerful, so don't leave him, stay close to him so that he can make you strong.
49005011	Recommendation	You should refuse everything bad that people do who walk in the dark. But you should say to them, “What you are doing is wrong.”
59004011	Recommendation	Brothers and sisters, don't blame each other saying, “You did something wrong today.” Stop that kind of talk. When God's people blame each other, it is like saying, “God's law is no good.” If you say that, you are not obeying God's law. And that is like deciding if God's law is good or bad.
49004002	Recommendation	Don't be proud, but go quietly on God's road. Be gentle and patient. And don't get tired of each other but keep loving one another all the time.
54004006	Faith	If you tell these things to God's people, you will be working well for Jesus Christ. You should always remember the things that God's people believe and you should keep on following the true teaching.
