46005001	Sin	Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations—as that one has the wife of the father!
46010013	Faith	No temptation has taken you—except that of man; and God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted above what you are able, but He will make, with the temptation, also the outlet, for your being able to bear [it].

43014001	Faith	“Do not let your heart be troubled, believe in God, believe also in Me;
50001028	Faith	and not be terrified in anything by those opposing, which is indeed a token of destruction to them, and to you of salvation, and that from God;
43015016	Grace	You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you might go away, and might bear fruit, and your fruit might remain, that whatever you may ask of the Father in My Name, He may give you.

59004008	Recommendation	draw near to God, and He will draw near to you; cleanse hands, you sinners! And purify hearts, you split-souled!
59002009	Sin	but if you favor by appearance, you work sin, being convicted by the Law as transgressors;
52004007	Grace	for God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.
45001018	Sin	for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven on all impiety and unrighteousness of men, holding down the truth in unrighteousness.
62004007	Faith	Beloved, may we love one another, because love is of God, and everyone loving has been begotten of God, and knows God;

43014015	Recommendation	If you love Me, keep My commands,
58012025	Recommendation	Watch out lest you refuse Him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who was divinely speaking on earth—much less we who turn away from Him who [speaks] from Heaven,
48004008	Sin	But then, indeed, having not known God, you were in servitude to those [that are] not by nature gods,
44003026	Grace	to you first, God, having raised up His child Jesus, sent Him, blessing you, in the turning away of each one from your evil ways.”

51003009	Recommendation	Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his practices,
66002020	Sin	But I have a few things against you: that you allow the woman Jezebel, who is calling herself a prophetess, to teach, and to lead astray, My servants to commit whoredom, and to eat idol-sacrifices;
48003008	Grace	and the Writing, having foreseen that God declares righteous the nations by faith, foretold the good news to Abraham:
58012005	Recommendation	and you have forgotten the exhortation that speaks fully to you as to sons, “My son, do not despise [the] discipline of [the] LORD, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,

65001011	Sin	woe to them! Because they went on in the way of Cain, and they rushed to the deceit of Balaam for reward, and in the controversy of Korah they perished.
65001010	Sin	But these, indeed, whatever [things] they have not known, they speak evil of; and whatever [they know], like the irrational beasts, they understand naturally—in these they are corrupted;
58011007	Faith	By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen, having feared, prepared an ark to the salvation of his house, through which he condemned the world, and he became heir of the righteousness according to faith.
58009006	Description	And these things having been thus prepared, into the first dwelling place, indeed, the priests go in at all times, performing the services,
44007051	Sin	You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and in ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers—also you;
54001009	Sin	having known this, that law is not set for a righteous man, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers,
46005009	Recommendation	I wrote to you in the letter, not to keep company with whoremongers—

51003022	Recommendation	the servants: obey those who are masters in all things according to the flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God;
66017012	Description	And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who did not yet receive a kingdom, but receive authority as kings one hour with the beast;
46002012	Grace	And we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that [is] of God, that we may know the things conferred by God on us,
59005001	Recommendation	Go, now, you rich! Weep, howling over your miseries that are coming on [you];
66002010	Recommendation	Do not be afraid of the things that you are about to suffer; behold, the Devil is about to cast [some] of you into prison, that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation ten days; become faithful to death, and I will give to you the garland of life.

66018009	Sin	and the kings of the earth will weep over her and strike themselves for her, who committed whoredom and indulged with her, when they may see the smoke of her burning,
43014023	Faith	Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone may love Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and We will make [an] abode with him;
62004010	Grace	in this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son [as] the propitiation for our sins.
62001007	Faith	and if we may walk in the light, as He is in the light—we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of His Son Jesus Christ cleanses us from every sin;
48004007	Grace	So that you are no longer a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.
58001008	Faith	but to the Son: “Your throne, O God, [is] throughout the age of the age; The scepter of righteousness [is the] scepter of Your kingdom;

58013006	Faith	so that we boldly say, “The LORD [is] to me a helper, and I will not fear what man will do to me.”
45014003	Recommendation	do not let him who is eating despise him who is not eating: and do not let him who is not eating judge him who is eating, for God received him.
45015005	Grace	And may the God of the endurance, and of the exhortation, give to you to have the same mind toward one another, according to Christ Jesus,
58007027	Description	who has no daily necessity, as the chief priests, to first offer up sacrifice for His own sins, then for those of the people; for this He did once, having offered up Himself;
62003017	Sin	and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his yearnings from him—how does the love of God remain in him?
47005008	Faith	we have courage, and are well pleased, rather, to be away from the home of the body, and to be at home with the LORD.
