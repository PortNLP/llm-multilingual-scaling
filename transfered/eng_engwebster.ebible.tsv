54004001	Sin	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons;
56003001	Recommendation	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
61003005	Sin	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
60003018	Grace	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit:
61002021	Sin	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
53003006	Recommendation	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received from us.
45005012	Sin	Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.
58011033	Faith	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
47004009	Faith	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
59004004	Sin	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
44016006	Description	Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia;
45010006	Faith	But the righteousness which is by faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down.)
66016002	Violence	And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast, and upon them who worshiped his image.
66005008	Description	And when he had taken the book, the four living beings, and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.
62005001	Faith	Whoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten by him.
48005026	Recommendation	Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
54005001	Recommendation	Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
60002012	Recommendation	Having your manner of life honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
50003006	Sin	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; with respect to the righteousness which is by the law, blameless.
43004052	Description	Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend: and they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
43019031	Violence	The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
43019012	Description	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesar's friend. Whoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cesar.
43014001	Faith	Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
50001028	Faith	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
43015016	Grace	Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
58011004	Faith	By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
46004001	Recommendation	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
66006013	Description	And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig-tree casteth its untimely figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind.
46010014	Recommendation	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
45012021	Recommendation	Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
55002014	Recommendation	Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they contend not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.
59004008	Recommendation	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.
59002009	Sin	But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
52004007	Grace	For God hath not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.
45001018	Sin	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
62004007	Faith	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is from God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
62002009	Sin	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
60004014	Grace	If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
44021019	Grace	And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
43008046	Sin	Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?

45003025	Grace	Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
43018018	Description	And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; (for it was cold) and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.

43013037	Faith	Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.
50004007	Faith	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, will keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
59003009	Faith	With this we bless God, even the Father; and with this we curse men, who are made after the similitude of God.
46005010	Sin	Yet not altogether with lewd persons of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters: for then ye must needs go out of the world.
44026009	Sin	I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

43010012	Description	But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
59001019	Recommendation	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
46009014	Recommendation	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.
43012046	Grace	I am come a light into the world, that whoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
43005014	Description	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art cured: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee.
46016014	Recommendation	Let all your things be done with charity.
43014015	Recommendation	If ye love me, keep my commandments.
58012025	Recommendation	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape , if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
48004008	Sin	However then, when ye knew not God, ye did service to them which by nature are no gods.
44003026	Grace	To you first, God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
44010039	Violence	And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree.
46001010	Recommendation	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.

51003001	Faith	If ye then be raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
66008007	Violence	The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
66011017	Faith	Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.
43004010	Grace	Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.
51003004	Grace	When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then will ye also appear with him in glory.
43020031	Faith	But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life through his name.
62004006	Faith	We are of God. He that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
65001012	Description	These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about by winds; withered autumnal trees, without fruit, twice dead, plucked out by the roots;
44005015	Description	So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.

51003023	Recommendation	And whatever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;
58012016	Recommendation	Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birth-right.
43018040	Sin	Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
55003004	Sin	Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
50002009	Grace	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
61001016	Description	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty.
61003016	Sin	As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.
44014014	Description	Which , when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of , they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
45015008	Faith	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:
59001026	Sin	If any man among you seemeth to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.
43015020	Recommendation	Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
43008031	Faith	Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed;

63001004	Faith	I rejoiced greatly, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
54005008	Faith	But if any provideth not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
58010022	Faith	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
48001023	Description	But they had heard only, That he who persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
44027034	Recommendation	Wherefore I pray you to take some food; for this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.
66002003	Faith	And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast labored, and hast not fainted.
56002002	Recommendation	That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience;

43014020	Faith	At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
62002003	Faith	And by this we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
43008024	Sin	I said therefore to you, that ye will die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he , ye will die in your sins.
66017006	Sin	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
58012017	Description	For ye know that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
43007012	Description	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceiveth the people.
44011021	Faith	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.
52002004	Faith	But as we were allowed by God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.
46015057	Grace	But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
54005005	Faith	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
43016024	Grace	Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
46007021	Recommendation	Art thou called being a servant? care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.
65001019	Sin	These are they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.

43021006	Description	And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
46007019	Recommendation	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
45012008	Recommendation	Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
44019002	Faith	He said to them, Have ye received the Holy Spirit since ye believed? And they said to him, We have not so much as heard whether there is any Holy Spirit.
53003014	Recommendation	And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
46015050	Sin	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
43006027	Recommendation	Labor not for the food which perisheth, but for that food which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
59004003	Sin	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.

66014005	Description	And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.

59001022	Recommendation	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
43007001	Violence	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
46001030	Grace	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who from God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
43013005	Description	After that, he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.

43007043	Description	So there was a division among the people because of him.
60005002	Recommendation	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight of it , not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but from a ready mind;
46015056	Sin	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
59005004	Sin	Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped your fields, which is by you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them who have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.

46004016	Recommendation	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

63001007	Sin	For many deceivers have entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and an antichrist.
44024005	Sin	For we have found this a pestilent man, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
54003016	Grace	And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

58011007	Faith	By faith Noah, being warned by God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
58009006	Description	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God :
44007051	Sin	Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did , so do ye.
54001009	Sin	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for man-slayers,

43014023	Faith	Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loveth me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.
62004010	Grace	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
62001007	Faith	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

58001008	Faith	But to the Son, he saith , Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom.
43010033	Sin	The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
66014011	Description	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receiveth the mark of his name.
47004001	Faith	Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
58013006	Faith	So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.

58007027	Description	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
62003017	Sin	But he who hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
47005008	Faith	We are confident, I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
60002011	Recommendation	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

45008037	Grace	But in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.
44026014	Violence	And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.
66002009	Sin	I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
46013006	Faith	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
59001021	Recommendation	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
46003006	Grace	I have planted, Apollos watered: but God hath given the increase.
66014008	Sin	And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her lewdness.

62005021	Recommendation	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

43019015	Violence	But they cried out, Away with him , away with him , crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.
45011005	Grace	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.

54005017	Recommendation	Let the elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.
46008007	Sin	But there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
43015002	Grace	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, he cleaneth it, that it my bring forth more fruit.

58011029	Description	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians essaying to do were drowned.
44007020	Description	In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished in his father's house three months:
58005002	Grace	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
45013012	Recommendation	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
49006009	Recommendation	And, ye masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
45012015	Recommendation	Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
45002005	Sin	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
44014019	Violence	And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch, and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
43013021	Description	When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you will betray me.
48003022	Faith	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
66011007	Violence	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
58003014	Faith	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;
45008010	Faith	And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
44007052	Sin	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them who showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers;
48005021	Sin	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
43012036	Faith	While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and concealed himself from them.
58003002	Faith	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.
