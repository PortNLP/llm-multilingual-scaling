48003022	Faith	But the scripture hath concluded all things under sin, that the promise of the faith of Jesus Christ were given to them that believe.
48005021	Sin	envies, manslayings, drunkennesses, unmeasurable eatings [or gluttonies], and things like to these, which I say to you before, as I have told to you before, for they that do such things, shall not have the kingdom of God.

51003021	Recommendation	Fathers, do not ye provoke your sons to indignation, that they be not made feeble-hearted.
46011027	Sin	Therefore whoever eateth the bread, or drinketh the cup of the Lord unworthily, he shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.
