60002016	Recommendation	As free , and not as hauing the libertie for a cloke of maliciousnesse , but as the seruauntes of God .
54004010	Faith	For therefore we labour and are rebuked , because we trust in the liuing God , which is the Sauiour of all men , specially of those that beleeue .
58010029	Sin	Of howe much sorer punishment suppose ye shall hee be worthy , which treadeth vnder foote the Sonne of God , and counteth the blood of the Testament as an vnholy thing , wherewith he was sanctified , and doeth despite the Spirit of grace ?

44022016	Recommendation	Now therefore why tariest thou ? Arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sinnes , in calling on the Name of the Lord .
66009008	Description	And they had heare as the heare of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lyons .
55002024	Recommendation	But the seruant of ye Lord must not striue , but must be gentle toward all men , apt to teache , suffering the euill ,
51002005	Faith	For though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , reioycing & beholding your order , and your stedfast faith in Christ .
60003012	Sin	For the eyes of the Lord are ouer the righteous , & his eares are open vnto their prayers : and the face of the Lord is against them that do euil .
53002013	Faith	But we ought to giue thankes alway to God for you , brethren beloued of the Lord , because that God hath from the beginning chosen you to saluation , through sanctification of the Spirit , and the faith of trueth ,
66022011	Recommendation	He that is vniust , let him be vniust stil and he which is filthie , let him be filthie still : and hee that is righteous , let him be righteous stil : and he that is holy , let him be holy still .

52005015	Recommendation	See that none recompense euil for euil vnto any man : but euer folow that which is good , both toward your selues , and toward all men .

43006054	Faith	Whosoeuer eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternall life , and I will raise him vp at the last day .
43019011	Sin	Iesus answered , Thou couldest haue no power at all against me , except it were giuen thee from aboue : therefore he that deliuered me vnto thee , hath the greater sinne .
59002017	Faith	Euen so the faith , if it haue no woorkes , is dead in it selfe .
45008003	Sin	For ( that that was impossible to ye Lawe , in as much as it was weake , because of ye flesh ) God sending his owne Sonne , in ye similitude of sinful flesh , & for sinne , condened sinne in the flesh ,
60003014	Recommendation	Notwithstanding blessed are ye , if ye suffer for righteousnes sake . Yea , feare not their feare , neither be troubled .

62002022	Sin	Who is a liar , but he that denyeth that Iesus is that Christ ? the same is that Antichrist that denyeth the Father and the Sonne .
46011027	Sin	Wherefore , whosoeuer shall eate this bread , and drinke the cup of the Lord vnworthily , shall be guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord .
59002020	Faith	But wilt thou vnderstand , O thou vaine man , that the faith which is without workes , is dead ?
43018003	Description	Iudas then , after hee had receiued a band of men and officers of the high Priests , and of the Pharises , came thither with lanternes and torches , and weapons .
53003003	Grace	But the Lord is faithfull , which wil stablish you , and keepe you from euill .
44007021	Description	And when he was cast out , Pharaos daughter tooke him vp , and nourished him for her owne sonne .
66008005	Description	And the Angel tooke the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth , and there were voyces , and thundrings , and lightnings , and earthquake .
